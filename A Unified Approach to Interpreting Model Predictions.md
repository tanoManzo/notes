The ability to correctly interpret a prediction modelâ€™s output is extremely important. In some applications, simple models (e.g., linear models) are often preferred for their ease of interpretation, even if they may be less accurate than complex ones.

A wide variety of different methods have been recently proposed to address this issue [5, 8, 9, 3, 4, 1]. But an understanding of how these methods relate and when one method is preferable to another is still lacking.

We present a novel unified approach to interpreting model predictions
