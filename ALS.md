## Main points

ALS (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis), also known as Lou Gehrig's disease. It's a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that affects nerve cells in the brain and the spinal cord.

| **Symptoms**     | The disease leads to muscle weakness, atrophy, and eventually paralysis. Early symptoms often include muscle twitching, cramping, stiffness, or weakness, particularly in the arms and legs. |
| **Cause**        | The exact cause of ALS is unknown in most cases, though a small percentage of cases are inherited through mutations in certain genes (familial ALS).                                         |
| **Diagnosis**    | Diagnosis is primarily clinical, based on symptoms and the progression of the disease, often supported by electromyography (EMG) and nerve conduction studies (NCS).                         |
| **Treatment**    | There is no cure for ALS, but treatments such as Riluzole and Edaravone can slow the progression of symptoms.                                                                                |
| **Prevalence**   | ALS is relatively rare, with an incidence of about 2 per 100,000 people annually.                                                                                                            |
| **Prognosis**    | The prognosis varies; however, the average life expectancy after diagnosis is 2-5 years, though some people live much longer.                                                                |
| **Famous Cases** | Lou Gehrig, the famous baseball player, and Stephen Hawking, the renowned physicist, are among the most well-known individuals diagnosed with ALS.                                           |

### What is the % of population suffering ALS? 

  
The prevalence of ALS (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis) is estimated to be about 2 to 4 cases per 100,000 people​ ([The ALS Association](https://www.als.org/navigating-als/resources/fyi-epidemiology-als-and-suspected-clusters))​​ ([MA Tracking](https://matracking.ehs.state.ma.us/Health-Data/ALS.html))​​ ([Mass.gov](https://www.mass.gov/info-details/als-lou-gehrigs-disease))​.
