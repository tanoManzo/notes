## Main points

ALS (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis), also known as Lou Gehrig's disease. It's a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that affects nerve cells in the brain and the spinal cord.

| **Aspect**       | **Details**                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| **Symptoms**     | The disease leads to muscle weakness, atrophy, and eventually paralysis. Early symptoms often include muscle twitching, cramping, stiffness, or weakness, particularly in the arms and legs. |
| **Cause**        | The exact cause of ALS is unknown in most cases, though a small percentage of cases are inherited through mutations in certain genes (familial ALS).                                         |
| **Diagnosis**    | Diagnosis is primarily clinical, based on symptoms and the progression of the disease, often supported by electromyography (EMG) and nerve conduction studies (NCS).                         |
| **Treatment**    | There is no cure for ALS, but treatments such as Riluzole and Edaravone can slow the progression of symptoms.                                                                                |
| **Prevalence**   | ALS is relatively rare, with an incidence of about 2 per 100,000 people annually.                                                                                                            |
| **Prognosis**    | The prognosis varies; however, the average life expectancy after diagnosis is 2-5 years, though some people live much longer.                                                                |
| **Famous Cases** | Lou Gehrig, the famous baseball player, and Stephen Hawking, the renowned physicist, are among the most well-known individuals diagnosed with ALS.                                           |

### What is the % of population suffering ALS?   
An estimated 29,824 cases were identified, for an adjusted prevalence of 9.1 per 100,000 U.S. population. The demographics of cases of ALS did not change from previous year’s reports. ALS continues to impact Whites, males, and persons over 50 years of age more so than other comparison groups. [PMID: **37602649**]

### What is the total number of GWAS studies targeting ALS? 

According to GWAS catalog, there are 41 studies related to ALS mainly in Europe
