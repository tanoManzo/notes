My current research focuses on developing and comparing deep learning models for predicting the effects of genetic variants on enhancer activity. I am exploring how emerging transformer architectures, known for their ability to capture long-range dependencies and parallel processing, perform in this domain compared to more established convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which have demonstrated success in genomic sequence analysis. By leveraging these advanced architectures, the goal is to improve the accuracy and interpretability of predicting variant impacts on enhancer regions, which play a critical role in gene expression and complex trait heritability.
