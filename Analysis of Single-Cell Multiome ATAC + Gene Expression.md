## The problem

## How usually you do
![[Pasted image 20240612103907.png]]

## Check for Gene-Expression (RNA-seq) and Chromatin-Accessibility (ATAC-seq)

each column is a different sample, each row is a different gene

## Limitation: Bulk rna-seq analysis (all the cells and all treatment on average)

same for ATAC-seq bulk (assay that allows us to look at regions of open chromatin e.g., where TF can bind or rna polymerase can come in to drive gene expression)
