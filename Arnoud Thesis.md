## Good 
- well structured resume
- Good State of the art, Section 2.
- Good interview description. Solid work.
- Good evaluation of the technology. 
- Good design of the web interface.
- Nice use of the devops and related tools.
## Bad
- Embedded solution were not mentioned. The great contribution of this work, it is the fact that your system can work with limited resources keeping the data safe. Otherwise, application like chatGPT  can do better. Therefore, smaller model but fine-tuned for the specific task. 
- Structured of the table of content can be improved by adding problem statement before Related Work section.
- Far fetched: "Ce rapport est structuré pour fournir une compréhension complète de la recherche menée et des résultats obtenus." at the end of the introduction. 
- Subsection 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3 do not belong to the methodology section. They are related to the formulation of the problem.
