On average, humans acquire about 100 new mutations (called **single nucleotide variants** or **SNVs**) per genome each generation. Interestingly, the number of SNVs in a newborn increases with the age of the father but not the mother. Also, your cells continue to mutate after you are born, and a bad mutation can cause cancer. Nevertheless, the mutation rate is low enough that a single “genome” can provide a decent sketch of who you are as an individual. Although genomes can mutate during replication, the cell has a number of proofreading mechanisms (one of which is **mismatch repair**) because it is under evolutionary pressure to maintain a functional genome. For this reason, there are only about 100 mutations after each replication in a human genome with approximately 3 billion nucleotides
