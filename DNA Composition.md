There are four different bases which distinguish one nucleotide from another — two larger bases called adenine (A) and guanine (G), and two smaller bases called thymine (T) and cytosine (C). A nucleotide is composed of three molecules bound together: a deoxyribose sugar, an inorganic phosphate, and a nitrogenous base.

**Phoebus Levene**, the man who first discovered the four nucleotides, claimed that DNA was made up of long repetitions of the four nucleotides stacked on one another in an invariant fashion. He called this theory the **tetra-nucleotide hypothesis** (TNH), but others referred to it as the “pancake model”.

 **Erwin Chargaff** doubted the TNH and sought to disprove it by directly measuring the relative levels of the four nucleotides to see whether they were truly equal. The observation by Chargaff that nA​/nT​≈1 and 1nG​/nC​≈1 immediately disproved the tetranucleotide hypothesis of nucleotide structure.

Today, this key observation is known as **Chargaff's rule**.

Chargaff visited **Watson and Crick** at Cambridge in 19521952 and discussed his findings. Only months later, Watson and Crick would publish the complete structure of DNA in _Nature_. They cited Chargaff's work as one of the most essential pieces of data that allowed their breakthrough, along with the XX-ray structures of Rosalind Franklin.

Levene and others had found that certain cellular structures — called **chromosomes**, for their deep coloring under a microscope — were rich in both proteins and DNA.

For nearly a century, biologists had observed that chromosomes are duplicated and lined up during cellular reproduction — with an equal amount going to each daughter cell — and that these structures are the carriers of hereditary information.

Proteins were known to consist of twenty possible building blocks called **amino acids**, allowing each amino acid to encode log2(​20)=4.3 bits of information.
