There are four different bases which distinguish one nucleotide from another — two larger bases called adenine (A) and guanine (G), and two smaller bases called thymine (T) and cytosine (C). A nucleotide is composed of three molecules bound together: a deoxyribose sugar, an inorganic phosphate, and a nitrogenous base.

**Phoebus Levene**, the man who first discovered the four nucleotides, claimed that DNA was made up of long repetitions of the four nucleotides stacked on one another in an invariant fashion. He called this theory the **tetra-nucleotide hypothesis** (TNH), but others referred to it as the “pancake model”.

 **Erwin Chargaff** doubted the TNH and sought to disprove it by directly measuring the relative levels of the four nucleotides to see whether they were truly equal.


Levene and others had found that certain cellular structures — called **chromosomes**, for their deep coloring under a microscope — were rich in both proteins and DNA.

For nearly a century, biologists had observed that chromosomes are duplicated and lined up during cellular reproduction — with an equal amount going to each daughter cell — and that these structures are the carriers of hereditary information.
