Chemical analysis of DNA quickly identified it consisted of four component nucleotides (A,T,C,G). A nucleotide is composed of three molecules bound together: a deoxyribose sugar, an inorganic phosphate, and a nitrogenous base.


**Phoebus Levene**, the man who first discovered the four nucleotides, claimed that DNA was made up of long repetitions of the four nucleotides stacked on one another in an invariant fashion. He called this theory the **tetra-nucleotide hypothesis** (TNH), but others referred to it as the “pancake model”.

 **Erwin Chargaff** doubted the TNH and sought to disprove it by directly measuring the relative levels of the four nucleotides to see whether they were truly equal.
