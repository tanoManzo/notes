We performed saturation mutagenesis in conjunction with massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs) on 21 regulatory elements, including 20 commonly studied, disease-relevant promoter and enhancer sequences from the literature, and one ultraconserved enhancer (UC88). For the former, we focused primarily on regulatory sequences in which specific mutations are known to cause disease, both for their clinical relevance and to provide for positive control variants. Selected elements were limited up to 600 base pairs (bp) for technical reasons related to the mapping of variants to barcodes by subassembly. In addition, we selected only sequences where cell line-based reporter assays were previously established.
