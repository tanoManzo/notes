Here's a table summarizing the main information about deaths from disease in major wars:

| **War**                 | **Time Period**    | **Total Deaths**                     | **Percentage of Military Deaths from Disease** | **Common Diseases**                                    | **Key Factors & Advances**                                                                                                                                  |
|-------------------------|--------------------|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Napoleonic Wars**     | 1803–1815         | 3.5–6 million                       | 60-70%                                        | Typhus, dysentery, pneumonia                          | Poor hygiene and overcrowding; typhus outbreaks during the Russian campaign contributed to Napoleon’s defeat.                                                |
| **American Civil War**  | 1861–1865         | 750,000                             | Two-thirds                                    | Dysentery, typhoid, pneumonia, malaria                | Lack of sanitation and medical knowledge; improved field hospitals and rudimentary antiseptics toward the end of the war.                                   |
| **World War I**         | 1914–1918         | 15–20 million                       | 30-50%                                        | Dysentery, typhoid fever, pneumonia, trench fever     | Unsanitary trench conditions; 1918 influenza pandemic affected soldiers and civilians, leading to high mortality at the war’s end.                          |
| **World War II**        | 1939–1945         | 70–85 million                       | 10-15%                                        | Malaria, dysentery, respiratory infections            | Introduction of antibiotics like penicillin, better field hospitals, and improved hygiene standards significantly reduced disease-related deaths.            |

This table highlights the reduction in disease-related military deaths over time due to advances in medical science and field hygiene practices.
### Napoleonic Wars (1803–1815)

- **Total Deaths**: Estimated **<span style="color:#FF6F61;">3.5-6 million</span>** military and civilian deaths.
- **Deaths from Disease**: Roughly **<span style="color:#FF6F61;">60-70%</span> of military deaths** were due to disease, not combat.
    - **Common Diseases**: Typhus, dysentery, and pneumonia, with typhus especially deadly among soldiers.
    - **Key Factors**: Poor hygiene, overcrowding, and lack of effective medical care contributed to high disease mortality.
    - **Notable Outbreaks**: Typhus outbreaks in 1812–1813 devastated Napoleon’s Grand Army during the Russian campaign, contributing to his defeat.

### American Civil War (1861–1865)

- **Total Deaths**: Approximately **<span style="color:#FF6F61;">750,000</span> deaths** in military and civilian populations.
- **Deaths from Disease**: Disease caused **<span style="color:#FF6F61;">two-thirds</span> of all deaths**, with around **<span style="color:#FF6F61;">500,000</span>** soldiers dying from infections.
    - **Common Diseases**: Dysentery, typhoid, pneumonia, and malaria.
    - **Key Factors**: Lack of sanitation and limited medical knowledge; field hospitals often had poor conditions, and contaminated water sources spread illness.
    - **Advances**: Introduction of field hospitals, improved surgical techniques, and rudimentary antiseptics toward the war's end helped reduce some mortality.

### World War I (1914–1918)

- **Total Deaths**: Approximately **<span style="color:#FF6F61;">15–20 million</span>** (military and civilian).
- **Deaths from Disease**: Around **<span style="color:#FF6F61;">30-50%</span>** of military deaths were due to disease rather than direct combat.
    - **Reasons**: Unsanitary trench conditions and close quarters facilitated disease spread.
    - **Common Diseases**: Dysentery, typhoid fever, pneumonia, and trench fever.
    - **1918 Influenza Pandemic**: The pandemic struck during the war’s end, affecting both soldiers and civilians, increasing mortality rates significantly.

### World War II (1939–1945)

- **Total Deaths**: Roughly **<span style="color:#FF6F61;">70–85 million</span>** worldwide (military and civilian).
- **Deaths from Disease**: Disease-related deaths dropped to about **<span style="color:#FF6F61;">10-15%</span>** of military casualties.
    - **Key Changes**:
        - **Antibiotics**: Introduction of penicillin greatly reduced deaths from wound infections and bacterial diseases.
        - **Improved Hygiene and Sanitation**: Better field hospital practices and increased hygiene standards decreased infection rates.
    - **Common Diseases**: Malaria, dysentery, and respiratory infections, particularly in tropical regions.

### Key Differences in Mortality Due to Disease Across Wars

- **Napoleonic Wars**: Disease was the dominant cause of death, with **<span style="color:#FF6F61;">60-70%</span>** of military fatalities.
- **American Civil War**: Approximately **<span style="color:#FF6F61;">two-thirds</span>** of all soldier deaths were from disease.
- **WWI**: Disease caused **<span style="color:#FF6F61;">30-50%</span>** of military deaths.
- **WWII**: Only **<span style="color:#FF6F61;">10-15%</span>** of military deaths were due to disease, thanks to antibiotics and better medical care.
