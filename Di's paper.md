## in the abstract 
Can you indicate which type of correlation (e.g., pearson) to the sentence: "..average correlation of 0.54.."

## in the intro
to the sentence: 

"Here to assess the functional roles of intronic and intergenic variants in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), we developed a deep learning model that integrates large-scale complementary epigenomic profiles of bulk and single cell levels"

I would add a comma after "Here, to assess.....", and I would use dash as you did in the abstract "single-cell" instead of "single cell"

## In Results 
### section: Deep Learning profiles ... 
do you have an explanation to the drop in performance from enhancer to silencer for the sentence: "(AUPRC) of 0.885 for enhancers and 0.637 for silencers on average"

### section: AD-associated ..

To the sentence at page 5: "This trend also was observed in blood cells ( SL loci vs all other loci) 40, key modulars of immune systems." I will change it in "This trend was **ALSO** observed in blood cells ( SL loci vs all other loci) 40, key **MODULATORS** of immune systems."

### section: SL-locuc radSVN

The sentence: "The exception cluster (the “pink” in Figure 4A) contains the genes upregulated across multiple cell types in the AD DLPFC, with an example of _MAPT_ which is upregulated in AD excitatory and inhibitory neurons, microglia and oligodendrocytes."

can be improved: "The exception cluster (the “pink” in Figure 4A) comprises genes that are upregulated across multiple cell types in the AD DLPFC. Notably, _MAPT_ serves as an example, showing increased expression in AD excitatory and inhibitory neurons, microglia, and oligodendrocytes."

### section: **Deep learning identifies AD causal variants through accurately quantifying their regulatory impacts.**

I would change the word "through" with the word "by" in the title of the section.
