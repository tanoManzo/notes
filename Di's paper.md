## in the abstract 
Can you indicate which type of correlation (e.g., pearson) to the sentence: "..average correlation of 0.54.."

## in the intro
to the sentence: 

"Here to assess the functional roles of intronic and intergenic variants in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), we developed a deep learning model that integrates large-scale complementary epigenomic profiles of bulk and single cell levels"

I would add a comma after "Here, to assess.....", and I would use dash as you did in the abstract "single-cell" instead of "single cell"

## In Results 
### section: Deep Learning profiles ... 
do you have an explanation to the drop in performance from enhancer to silencer for the sentence: "(AUPRC) of 0.885 for enhancers and 0.637 for silencers on average"
