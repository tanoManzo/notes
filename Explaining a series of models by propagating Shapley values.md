## abstract 
Local feature attribution methods are increasingly used to explain complex machine learning models. 

Current methods expensive to compute and not capable of explaining a distributed series of models.

Generalized DeepSHAP (GDeepSHAP), a tractable method to propagate local feature attributions through complex series of models based on a connection to the Shapley value. 

We evaluate G-DeepSHAP across biological, health, and financial datasets. 


## General 

Explaining a series of models is crucial for debugging and building trust, even more so because a series of models is inherently harder to explain compared to a single model.
