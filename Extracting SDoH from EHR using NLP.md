## Intro 
The annual County Health Rankings ([County Health Rankings & Roadmaps](https://www.countyhealthrankings.org/)) gauge the impact of a wide range of health factors by ranking the health outcomes of the over 3000 counties across the United States.

Social, economic, and physical environment factors contribute the most to health outcomes (50%), followed by health behaviors (30%).
