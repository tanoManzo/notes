a McKinsey study for **400% increase in performance**


## Step 1: Create The Optimal Skill x Challenge Ratio

When a task **slightly exceeds our skills**, that's when the brain becomes most engaged - and more likely to enter flow.

## Step 2: Create A Distraction-Free Environment

If you want to enter flow, get serious about removing distractions:

- Put your smartphone out of sight
- Turn notifications off
- Download app/website blockers (I use [App Block](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/r8u76mgzg0h9ulwmolh2hxkp3n66/8ghqhohlxq30kvik/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYXBwYmxvY2suYXBwLw==))
- Put on noise-canceling headphones

## Step 3: Use Cognitive Optimization Hacks

Use 'cognitive optimization hacks' to get a mental boost and reach a deeper, more prolonged flow state:

- Listen to [binaural beats](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/r8u76mgzg0h9ulwmolh2hxkp3n66/vqh3hrhpde4x89fg/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueW91dHViZS5jb20vd2F0Y2g_dj1VMGVMbXlKa1FCYw==)​
- Consume caffeine (coffee, dark chocolate, green tea)
- Drink enough water (to prevent brain fog)
- Meditate for 10 minutes before work

## Step 4: Work In 45 to 90-Minute Cycles

The optimal length for a focus session is about 90 minutes.

But if you struggle with staying focused for so long, start with 45 minutes until your focus 'muscles' are strong enough to handle the full 90 minutes.

## Step 5: Take A ‘Mental Recharge’ Break

Working in a flow state is hard work for the brain.

So, after a deep focus session, take a 10–30 minute break to recharge your mental energy.

During this break, don’t overload your brain with more information to process, so avoid activities like:

- Checking email
- Scrolling through social media
- Reading the news
- Working on other tasks

To truly recharge your mental energy (and get in an optimal state for a second flow state session), take a high-quality break:

- Get a cup of water, coffee, or tea
- Grab a healthy snack
- Get moving to promote blood flow to the brain (stretching, walking, push-ups, squats, etc.)
- Practice a short meditation or breathwork exercise

(After this break, you can do another flow session. I recommend a maximum of **3x 90-minute flow sessions per day**.)
