## Reviewer 1

1.       **Introduction**

- The biological relevance of this work is clear from the beginning of the description, and the authors seem to focus on a specific biological problem (SNPs detection in DNA sequences). However, after this announcement of the relevance of the work, they rapidly get into the description and details of methods and architectures. A quite fast point of description and differences concerning the methods and/or architectures might help to a “bio-informatician” (more bio than informatician) to smoothly get into it.
- Done 

- At the end of the introduction the authors take three paragraphs to describe their work, personally I think is really useful to give a little info of the main goal and findings, but personally the paragraphs are somehow ensuring that the lector will probably not move forward with the paper because they already have all the details.
- Do

2.       **Results**

- I am impressed on how well and precise everything is described. It is even nice that since the beginning the authors try to keep the biological relevance of this work, using different cell lines and focusing on the biological problem they are tackling. However, for the users or biologist that will try to understand and go further, the differences between architectures and specifics rise the following questions:

- Depending of the goal of my biological question, should I select a specific method?

	- If yes, experimentally, how what I should take into account concerning data quality?

- Because, while using cell lines “most” of variables and quality is under control, by what about real cases?

- How do this metholodogy and test should be applied for “real life” cases, samples collected from patients of different diseases or treatments?

- As mentioned before, the work here is really interesting, but:

1.       how much time a data might be needed to fine-tune models?

2.       what they need is already available or data sets for controls and training might be need to be obtain before working with real samples?

3.       **Final comment,**

•          I fully agree with the authors that this kind of work, where the state-of-the-art of methods and architectures are tested and compared is need. But, real test, using other kind of data, might be also useful to better get into the real problems while using “not controlled” data.
