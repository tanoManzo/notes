Nevertheless, the COURAGE-PD dataset confirmed the role of the previously published _TMEM175_ variant as a genetic determinant of the AAO of PD with Bonferroni-corrected nominal levels of significance (_p_ < 0.025): (rs34311866: β(SE)COURAGE = 0.477(0.203), _p_COURAGE = 0.0185). The subsequent meta-analysis of COURAGE-PD and IPDGC datasets (Ntotal = 25,950) led to the identification of 2 genome-wide significant association signals on Chr 4, including the previously reported _SNCA_ locus (rs983361: β(SE)COURAGE+IPDGC = 0.720(0.122), _p_COURAGE+IPDGC = 3.13 × 10−9) and a novel _BST1_ locus (rs4698412: β(SE)COURAGE+IPDGC = −0.526(0.096), _p_COURAGE+IPDGC = 4.41 × 10−8).

### Discussion 

Our study further refines the genetic architecture of Chr 4 underlying the AAO of the PD phenotype through the identification of _BST1_ as a novel AAO PD locus.

We also considered Bonferroni-corrected _p_ < 0.025 for reporting replication signals originating from 2 single-nucleotide variations (SNVs [formerly SNPs]; rs356203 [_SNCA_] and rs34311866 [_TMEM175_]) that reached a genome-wide significance in the previous largest meta-analysis of the AAO of PD. We conducted linkage disequilibrium (LD) score regression with LDSC (using summary-level data) to estimate heritability explained by the PD AAO GWAS.[17](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9484604/#R17)
