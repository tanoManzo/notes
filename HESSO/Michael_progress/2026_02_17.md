# Executive Summary

## 1. Strategic Research Direction

- The project is evolving toward a distributed architecture based on multiple **SLMs (Small Language Models)**.
- This shift introduces new challenges in:
  - **Explainability**
  - **Accountability**
- A promising direction is an architecture where:
  - A **knowledge graph orchestrates agents**
  - Each node represents a specialized agent
  - The graph dynamically routes queries to the most contextually appropriate agent
- This approach could strengthen transparency, contextual routing, and traceability.

---

## 2. Project & Administrative Status

- Initiative response received; additional procedural steps remain.
  - Final decision expected within ~1 month.
- Follow-up needed with **Daniel Ruflet** regarding *Elite Act*.
- Swiss check-in project (with Rio) likely to accelerate soon.
  - Plan to prepare a project template.
  - Prefer to let André finish the current check before starting the next phase to avoid overload.

---

## 3. Workload & Team Dynamics

- Concern that André may be overloaded.
- Currently involved in:
  - Harrison
  - ConnectCare
  - Arkeo Agents (Archaeology)
  - Julio proposal
- Even with partial allocation per project, **context switching cost is high**.
- Transition phase:
  - Moving from structured research environment (ADAP/META)
  - Into hybrid model combining:
    - Software engineering
    - Proposal writing
    - Strategic research design
- Adjustment period (< 6 months) is normal but requires active workload management.

---

## 4. Research vs. Software Engineering Balance

- Internal discussion about excessive time spent on software engineering (e.g., price cloning).
- Temporary diversion from Harrison core research questions.
- However:
  - Agile 2-week sprints allow course correction.
  - Not critical unless sustained over several months.
- Strategic priority:
  - Define strong research questions
  - Produce publishable results
  - Maintain infrastructure without letting it dominate research output

---

## 5. Responsibility Reallocation

- Proposal writing leadership (e.g., Julio proposal) to be redistributed.
- André and Elia to focus primarily on:
  - Research questions
  - Publications
- Proposal writing remains important for postdoc development,
  but sequencing is preferable to parallel overload.
- After closing the current check, André may take more structured responsibility in **Arkeo Agents**.

---

## 6. Career & Publication Strategy

Key objectives:

- Publish in strong journals and conferences.
- Develop proposal-writing competency progressively.
- Avoid fragmentation that prevents high-quality research output.
- Align engineering efforts tightly with publishable research outcomes.

## 7. Next Meeting

- In-person meeting planned for the week of **March 16–20**.
- Preferred option: **Monday, March 16**.
