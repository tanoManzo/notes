High Pre-Training Costs


Fine-Tuning Overhead


High Inference Latency: 


Tasks Not Solvable By Scale: Given the current progress, one may question whether there are limits we deem impossible to overcome with in the current paradigm of scaling data/model sizes of autoregressive Transformer-based LLMs.
