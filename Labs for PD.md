- Yulan Xiong
    
    An assistant professor of neuroscience at UConn Health who discovered a mechanism that regulates a gene associated with Parkinson's disease
    
- Andy Singleton
    
    A researcher at the National Institute on Aging who found that a gene variant called GBA1 increases the risk of Parkinson's disease by about 50% if someone carries one copy and by about 400% if they carry two
    
- Ignacio Mata
    
    A researcher at the Cleveland Clinic Lerner College of Medicine who led the first genome-wide association study (GWAS) of Latinos with Parkinson's disease in South America
    
- Steven Lubbe
    
    A researcher who found four genetic variants that increase the risk of Parkinson's disease by comparing short tandem repeats (STRs) in people with and without the disease
    
- Ekemeni Riley
    
    The managing director of Aligning Science Across Parkinson's, a research initiative that found a gene variant that can nearly quadruple the risk of Parkinson's disease for people of African ancestry
