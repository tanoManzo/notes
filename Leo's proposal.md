Health disparities refer to differences in health outcomes, disease prevalence, and access to healthcare resources among different demographic groups defined by factors including but not limited to gender, race, ethnicity, education, income, disability, or sexual orientation. 

Non-patient-specific factors contributing to differences in health outcomes include Social Determinants of Health ([[SDoH]]) and systemic racism and discrimination. The National Institutes of Health declared this challenge a top priority and created The National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities to focus solely on investigating and mitigating health disparities.
