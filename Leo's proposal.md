Health disparities refer to differences in health outcomes, disease prevalence, and access to healthcare resources among different demographic groups defined by factors including but not limited to gender, race, ethnicity, education, income, disability, or sexual orientation. 

Non-patient-specific factors contributing to differences in health outcomes include Social Determinants of Health ([[SDoH]]) and systemic racism and discrimination. The National Institutes of Health declared this challenge a top priority and created The National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities to focus solely on investigating and mitigating health disparities.

**_Traditional demographic labels do not capture the complexity and nuances of health disparities._**
Traditional labels associated with disparities include race/ethnicity, sex, socioeconomic status, geographic location, and limited English proficiency, among others. However, other social, economic, and environmental factors have been shown to have significant impacts on health disparities.

The groups affected by specific health disparities often lie at the intersection of traditional demographic labels, such as age, race-ethnicity, or English proficiency. It is imperative to develop new and more accurate methods for identifying and tracking health disparities beyond traditional demographic labels as a prerequisite to building fair models (Fig 2).

Community-level SDoH measures broad socioeconomic, neighborhood, and environmental characteristics such as unemployment rate, access to public transportation, and air pollution levels. They serve as “vital community signs'' that reflect complex societal factors and health disparities that influence one’s health. On the other hand, less is known about individual-level SDoH as access has been limited due to the lack of standardized and validated SDoH screening questions and privacy concerns.
