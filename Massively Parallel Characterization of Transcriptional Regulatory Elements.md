## Summary

This study presents a large-scale functional analysis of **cis-regulatory elements (cCREs)** using an improved **lentivirus-based massively parallel reporter assay (lentiMPRA)** across three cell types (HepG2, K562, WTC11). The authors tested over **680,000 sequences** to analyze promoter/enhancer function and train **sequence-based models** for predicting cCRE activity and variant effects.

## üî¨ **Key Findings**

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Functional Characterization of cCREs

- **41.7% of tested sequences exhibited regulatory activity**.
- **Promoters vs. Enhancers**:
    - Promoters show **strong orientation dependence** and act as **universal ‚Äúon switches‚Äù**.
    - Enhancers have **weaker orientation bias** but **greater tissue specificity**.
- **MPRA measurements correlate with endogenous gene expression** but do not fully explain cell-type-specific regulation.

## ü§ñ **AI Models for Predicting cCRE Activity**

The study benchmarks **sequence-based deep learning models** against **biochemical models** for predicting enhancer/promoter activity.

### **Models Tested**

|Model|Type|Architecture|Key Features|Performance (Pearson r)|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|**MPRALegNet**|CNN|EfficientNetV2-inspired|Optimized conv layers, pooling|**0.83**|
|**MPRAnn**|CNN|Standard CNN|Baseline sequence model|0.79|
|**EnformerMPRA**|CNN + Transformer|Enformer backbone|Uses 5,313 biochemical features + regression|0.81|
|**SeiMPRA**|CNN + Transformer|Sei framework|21,907 biochemical features + regression|**0.87**|
|**Biochemical Model**|LASSO Regression|Non-sequence-based|Uses epigenomic features|0.72|

### **Findings**

- **Sequence-based models outperform biochemical models**.
- **MPRALegNet (CNN)** achieves the best performance relative to model complexity.
- **Transformer-based models (EnformerMPRA, SeiMPRA) achieve the best overall prediction power** but are **computationally expensive**.
- The **best models reach experimental reproducibility levels**, meaning further improvement would require more training data.

## üîç **Predicting Variant Effects & Fine-Mapping**

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Model Predictions of Regulatory Variants**

- **Tested on GWAS SNPs and allele-specific regulatory variants**.
- **MPRALegNet and EnformerMPRA successfully predict enhancer disruptions**.
- **Key predicted loss-of-function (LOF) SNPs:**
    - **RBM38 (rs2426715, rs376911010, rs737092)**
    - **LMO2 enhancer (rs75395676)**
- **Performance on allele-specific binding (ASB) datasets:**
    - **EnformerMPRA and MPRALegNet predictions align well with ChIP‚Äìseq and ATAC-seq validated ASVs.**
    - **Odds ratio > 2.1 in all tested cases**, indicating strong enrichment for true regulatory variants.

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Variant Effect Predictions vs. Experimental Saturation Mutagenesis**

- **PKLR enhancer MPRA dataset** used to validate predictions.
- **MPRALegNet identified key TF binding sites** and predicted **effect sizes of mutations**.
- Correlation with **real MPRA data**:
    - **PKLR (K562): r = 0.65**
    - **SORT1 (HepG2): r = 0.49**
    - **LDLR (HepG2): r = 0.66**
    - **F9 (HepG2): r = 0.51**
- **Similar performance to Enformer**, but MPRALegNet is **200x smaller in size**, making it more efficient for genome-wide inference.

## üéØ **Key Machine Learning Insights**

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Universal vs. Cell-Specific TF Motifs**

- **Universal motifs (found in all cell types)**:
    - **KLF-related**
    - **ETS-related**
    - **CTCF (context-dependent activation/repression)**
- **Cell-specific motifs**:
    - **HepG2**: **HNF4A/G** (hepatic function)
    - **K562**: **GATA-TAL1 dimer** (hematopoietic regulation)
    - **WTC11**: **POU5F1-SOX2** (pluripotency)

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Combinatorial Effects of TF Binding Sites**

- **Homotypic TFBS effects**:
    - Most TFs follow **log-additive activation patterns**.
    - **Some TFs (e.g., STAT, ETS) show saturation effects at high binding site dosages.**
- **Heterotypic TFBS interactions**:
    - **Super-multiplicative activation**: ATF3/FOS‚ÄìJUN + FOXD2
    - **Sub-multiplicative repression**: HNF4A/G + NFYA/C
    - **MPRALegNet accurately models these interactions**.

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Cross-Cell-Type Generalization**

- **MPRALegNet was trained on only 3 cell types but generalizes well**.
- **Supports the use of cell-type-agnostic models for variant effect predictions.**
- **Enformer and SeiMPRA outperform on fine-mapping tasks**, but **MPRALegNet is more efficient**.

## üèÜ **Implications**

- **High-throughput lentiMPRA is a scalable method to functionally map regulatory elements.**
- **Deep learning models enable accurate, genome-wide enhancer/promoter activity prediction.**
- **MPRALegNet is an efficient alternative to transformer-based models for regulatory genomics.**
- **Fine-mapping efforts for GWAS hits can benefit from these models to prioritize causal variants.**
- **Future work should integrate single-cell epigenomics and train on primary tissues.**

## üìå **Next Steps**

- **Expand to more cell types & disease-relevant tissues.**
- **Integrate MPRA with single-cell chromatin and transcriptomic data.**
- **Validate regulatory SNPs in functional assays (e.g., CRISPR screens).**
- **Develop genome-wide variant effect predictors based on trained models.**
