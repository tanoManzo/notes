Chromatin annotations refer to the identification and labeling of specific features or functional elements within the [[chromatin]], which is the complex of DNA, RNA, and proteins in the nucleus of a cell. These annotations provide insights into the organization and regulation of the genome. Researchers use various experimental techniques and computational methods to annotate chromatin and identify key elements.
