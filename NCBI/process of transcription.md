  
Transcription is the process by which the information encoded in DNA is used to synthesize a complementary RNA molecule. This process is a key step in gene expression, and it occurs in the cell nucleus. The basic steps of transcription can be summarized as follows:

1. **Initiation:**
    
    - The process begins with the recognition of a specific DNA sequence, known as the promoter, by RNA polymerase. Promoters are located near the beginning of genes.
    - Transcription factors bind to the promoter region, facilitating the binding of RNA polymerase to the DNA.
    - RNA polymerase begins to unwind the DNA double helix, creating a transcription bubble.
2. **Elongation:**
    
    - RNA polymerase moves along the DNA template strand in the 3' to 5' direction, synthesizing a complementary RNA strand in the 5' to 3' direction.
    - As RNA polymerase moves along the DNA, it continues to unwind the DNA double helix ahead of the transcription bubble and rewinds it behind.
3. **RNA Synthesis:**
    
    - Ribonucleotides (A, U, C, and G) are selected and added to the growing RNA chain, complementary to the template DNA strand.
    - Adenine (A) in DNA corresponds to uracil (U) in RNA, thymine (T) in DNA corresponds to adenine (A) in RNA, cytosine (C) pairs with guanine (G), and guanine (G) pairs with cytosine (C).
4. **Termination:**
    
    - Transcription continues until RNA polymerase encounters a specific termination signal in the DNA.
    - In prokaryotes, termination often involves the formation of a hairpin loop in the RNA transcript, causing RNA polymerase to detach from the DNA.
    - In eukaryotes, termination is more complex and involves the recognition of specific signals and the cleavage of the pre-mRNA.
5. **Post-Transcriptional Modifications (Eukaryotes):**
    
    - In eukaryotes, the initial transcript (pre-mRNA) undergoes post-transcriptional modifications before becoming mature mRNA.
    - These modifications include the addition of a 5' cap, the splicing out of introns, and the addition of a poly-A tail at the 3' end.

The newly synthesized RNA molecule, now called messenger RNA (mRNA), carries the genetic information from the DNA to the ribosomes in the cytoplasm, where it serves as a template for protein synthesis during translation. The process of transcription is tightly regulated, and different cells and tissues regulate gene expression by modulating the transcription of specific genes at different times and under various conditions.
