Natural language generation plays a critical role for Conversational Agents as it has a significant impact on a user’s impression of the system. This shared task focuses on recent end-to-end (E2E), data-driven NLG methods, which jointly learn sentence planning and surface realisation from non-aligned data, e.g. ([Wen et al., 2015](http://aclweb.org/anthology/D15-1199); [Mei et al., 2016](http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/N16-1086); [Dusek and Jurcicek, 2016](http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P16-2008); [Lampouras and Vlachos, 2016](https://aclweb.org/anthology/C16-1105)) etc.
