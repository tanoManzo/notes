Comparative Analysis of Deep Learning Models for Predicting Causative Regulatory Variants

Identifying the effects of non-coding regulatory variants is challenging due to:

Linkage disequilibrium in GWAS, which blurs causal variant resolution

Experimental mapping being time-consuming and resource-intensive

Complex, subtle patterns in regulatory sequences that are hard to decode computationally
