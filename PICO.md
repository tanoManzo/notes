Patient Intervention Comparison Outcome

1) move part of the related work to explain the limitation of the  EBM-NLP dataset to the related work section to enhance readability and highlight authors' contribution. 
To improve on these areas, we proposed FinePICO, a semi-supervised learning (SSL) algorithm to enhance the extraction of fine-grained PICO entities. Our main objective was to demonstrate that combining limited labeled data and a substantial volume of unlabeled data can achieve performance comparable to that of models trained using fully annotated data.
2) generate pseudo labels
3) Class-wise typo
4) How from raw-pseudo data, we have high-quality data labels. Why not to use an LLM from the begging.
