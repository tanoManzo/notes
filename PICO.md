To improve on these areas, we proposed FinePICO, a semi-supervised learning (SSL) algorithm to enhance the extraction of fine-grained PICO entities. Our main objective was to demonstrate that combining limited labeled data and a substantial volume of unlabeled data can achieve performance comparable to that of models trained using fully annotated data.

Once the initial model is trained, it is deployed to make inferences on the unlabeled data, referred to as pseudo-labels. We enrich the original labeled data with the high-confidence pseudo-labeled data for fine-tuning the model. We iteratively repeat the cycle of generating pseudo-labels and updating model weights until the modelâ€™s performance converges on the validation dataset or a predefined maximum number of iterations has been reached
2) generate pseudo labels
3) Class-wise typo
4) How from raw-pseudo data, we have high-quality data labels. Why not to use an LLM from the begging. .

The paper focuses on extracting PICO elements clinical trial papers, which is important for finding and understanding clinical evidence. Current methods only identify these elements in a broad way, but this study introduces a new model, **FinePICO**, to capture more specific details. The model is trained using a mix of labeled and unlabeled data through a semi-supervised approach. It is tested on 2,511 abstracts and compared to a simpler baseline model. Results show that FinePICO performs better and works well on different datasets and frameworks, making it a useful tool for clinical research.


The paper presents FinePICO a semi-supervised model to extract PICO elements form clinical trial papers. The model uses labeled and un-labeled data, in particular the first step is to use a BERT-based model to extract the "best model check point" or baseline M0, which will be user to predict un-label data. This predicition will provide "raw-pseudo data", which will be preprocess (confident, class-wise, and distillation) to obtain the "highquility pseudo labels". This is a interative process, which will be repeated Mn by using the curated data.

I have several concerns about this approach, particularly regarding the reliance on pseudo-labeling as part of the iterative training loop. (I) The model generates new pseudo-labels for unlabeled data based on predictions made by a version of itself trained on the labeled dataset. This process risks introducing and amplifying biases present in the original labeled dataset. If the labeled data has imbalanced representation across classes or systematic annotation errors, these issues may propagate and even intensify in the pseudo-labeled dataset. (II) While the process includes steps to filter and preprocess the pseudo-labels (e.g., confidence filtering and knowledge distillation), the effectiveness of these steps in mitigating bias and ensuring data quality remains unclear. Without rigorous quality control mechanisms, the pseudo-labeling process might introduce noise or inaccuracies, undermining the training of subsequent models in the loop. (III) The approach relies heavily on the model's ability to self-improve through iterative pseudo-labeling. However, there is no mention of independent validation measures to ensure that the generated pseudo-labels are genuinely improving the model's understanding of the data, rather than reinforcing existing patterns or biases. (IV) Finally, training repeatedly on pseudo-labels derived from the model's own predictions could lead to overfitting to patterns in the pseudo-labeled data, reducing the model's ability to generalize to entirely new datasets or frameworks.

As minor remarks, (I) in the introduction, please consider to remove some part more ralated to the state of the art and highlight the contribitions. The current introduction looks more like a related works section. (II) Please consider to move the figure within the text chapter for enhancing readability. (II)
