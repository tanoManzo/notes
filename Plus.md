### **1. DREME (Discriminative Regular Expression Motif Elicitation)**

- **Purpose**: Identifies short, statistically significant **motifs** (usually 6-8 nucleotides long) that occur more frequently in an input set of sequences compared to a control set.
    
- **Method**:
    
    - Uses an **efficient heuristic algorithm** to find **regular expression-like motifs** that are overrepresented.
        
    - Employs **p-values** and **E-values** to rank motifs based on significance.
        
    - Faster than MEME, but **finds simpler motifs**.
        
- **Output**: Provides a list of **short motifs** with their occurrence frequency and **statistical significance**.
    

### **2. MEME (Multiple EM for Motif Elicitation)**

- **Purpose**: Identifies **longer**, more complex **de novo motifs** in **unbiased** sequence data.
    
- **Method**:
    
    - Uses the **Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm** to iteratively refine motifs that best explain the observed sequences.
        
    - Can detect motifs in **three different modes**:
        
        - **OOPS (One Occurrence Per Sequence)** – assumes each sequence contains exactly **one** instance of the motif.
            
        - **ZOOPS (Zero or One Occurrence Per Sequence)** – assumes each sequence contains **zero or one** instance of the motif.
            
        - **TCM (Two-Component Mixture)** – assumes motifs can occur **multiple times** in a sequence.
            
- **Limitations**: Computationally expensive, so it is run on a **subset (600 sequences) of the input data** in MEME-ChIP.
    
- **Output**: Provides motifs as **position-specific probability matrices (PSPMs)**, along with **E-values** for statistical significance.
    

### **3. AME (Analysis of Motif Enrichment)**

- **Purpose**: Determines whether known motifs (e.g., from the **JASPAR CORE database**) are statistically enriched in a given set of sequences.
    
- **Method**:
    
    - Takes an input motif **database (like JASPAR, TRANSFAC, etc.)** and compares it to the input sequences.
        
    - Uses **rank-based enrichment tests** to calculate **p-values** and **E-values** for each motif.
        
    - Can apply different scoring methods, such as **Wilcoxon rank-sum test**, **Fisher’s Exact Test**, or **Binomial Test**.
        
- **Output**: Lists **significantly enriched motifs** with **statistical scores**, helping determine which known transcription factor (TF) motifs are **most relevant** to the dataset.
