Noncoding genomic variations constitute the majority of disease and other trait-associated [[single-nucleotide polymorphisms]] (SNPs) but characterizing their functional effects remains a challenge. 


Recent progress on prioritizing functional noncoding variants has been made by integrating evolutionary conservation and genomic and [[chromatin annotations]] at the position of interest.
