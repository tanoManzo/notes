**Central Dogma**
DNA​ --> RNA --> ​Protein -?-> ​phenotype.

DNA and the shortlived RNA transcripts both speak the language of nucleotides, though there are subtle differences in their sequences and structure. Once the RNA is **translated** into proteins, the molecular language must change. This is carried out by an amazing molecular machine known as the **ribosome**, along with a dictionary of helper molecules known as **tRNAs**.
