**Central Dogma**
DNA​ --> RNA --> ​Protein -?-> ​phenotype.

DNA and the shortlived RNA transcripts both speak the language of nucleotides, though there are subtle differences in their sequences and structure. Once the RNA is **translated** into proteins, the molecular language must change. This is carried out by an amazing molecular machine known as the **ribosome**, along with a dictionary of helper molecules known as **tRNAs**.

The first step in this pipeline is the **transcription** of double-stranded DNA genome into a single-stranded, short-lived messenger molecule called **messenger RNA** (mRNA).

Like DNA, RNA consists of four nucleotides, but whereas DNA uses �,A, �,T, �,G, and �,C, in RNA the �T (thymine) is replaced by �U (uracil). This difference is only a single carbon atom, and is likely a molecular fossil remnant of a time before DNA evolved. 

DNA and RNA also share an incredibly important feature — they can only be assembled in one direction.

Just as LEGO bricks can only be stacked in one way, the 5′5′ and 3′3′ ends of the nucleotide molecule can only fit together in one direction to form its backbone.

This is the customary **sense** order chosen for writing nucleotide molecules as strings. When DNA and RNA sequences are written as a string of letters, we can always be sure that the molecule represented starts from a 5′ and ends with a 3′.

DNA is almost always double-stranded, with both a **coding** strand and a complementary **template** strand in the reverse direction. Usually only one of these strands encodes an mRNA, but there are two 5′ ends to start reading from, each of which would end up as a different RNA sequence. How can the RNA polymerase (or an enterprising biologist given a DNA molecule) know which strand to read and transcribe?

Biology has solved this problem by using a **promoter** sequence, a canonical example of which is the “TATA box,” a short nucleotide sequence TATAAAA found on the coding strand just before the start of the gene.

But while there are only 4 different nucleotides, there are 4<sup>2</sup>=16 different nucleotide doublets. By considering groups of nucleotides instead of single positions, we end up with nucleotide “words” which are called **codons**.
