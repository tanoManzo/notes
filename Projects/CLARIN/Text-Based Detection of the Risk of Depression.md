## abstract
This study examines the relationship between language use and psychological characteristics of the communicator. The aim of the study was to find models predicting the depressivity of the writer based on the computational linguistic markers of his/her written text.

Depressivity was measured using the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21). 

The 10th Revision of International Classification of Diseases ICD-10, which is the basis for diagnosing mental disorders in the Czech Republic, classifies depression as an affective disorder (mood disorder).

One of the first symptoms is a change in mood toward the negative pole: the individual feels sad, needless, and/or unimportant. The disorder significantly affects self-confidence, which is often reflected in social relationships. It is typically accompanied by vegetative symptoms which can manifest as gastrointestinal problems (nausea, diarrhea etc.), tremors, sweating, or dry mouth. Sleep is also affected: the individual may have problems falling asleep, waking up, or staying asleep through the night. The effects of depression extend beyond the individual patient, with negative impact on patients’ employers, spouses, and children (Scott, 1995; Stewart et al., 2003; Sills et al., 2007).

## Goals
Early detection of an individual at risk of depression in initial stages and in mild form is beneficial both for the individual and society. Our study contributes to screening of individuals at risk of this disease. The study provides the original way of depression screening based on an analysis of how the writer uses the language to enable the automatic detection of writer’s risk of depression.

Demjén focused on an analysis of metaphors used by people suffering from depression (i.e., metaphors of separation or loss of control). She found that Sylvia Plath used the second person singular when writing about experiences of conflict or separation. A quantitative analysis of whole texts (not only of the area of metaphors) showed that writers suffering from depression tended to use negative words and expressions with quantifiers with extreme poles (e.g., “everything,” “nothing,” “always,” “never”; Demjén, 2014).
