[[SDoH]] [[Health Literacy]]


The World Health Organization has defined HL as ‘the cognitive and social skills which determine the motivation and ability of individuals to gain access to, understand, and use information in ways which promote and maintain good health.’

Based on this definition, three levels of HL have been described: functional, communicative and critical.

Literature searches were conducted to identify studies of HL. We searched MEDLINE using ‘health literacy’ as a keyword and retrieved 371 articles published in English between 1985 and 2006. 

On the other hand, it has been noted that even individuals with adequate literacy might not have adequate HL because the literacy demands of the health‐care context is often more complex than that of everyday life. [](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5060442/#b12)

## By NLM
What is health literacy?  The term was first used in a 1974 paper titled Health education as social policy.3 In discussing health education as a policy issue affecting the health care system, the educational system, and mass communication, the author calls for minimum standards for "health literacy" for all school grade levels. This early use of the term shows there is a link between health literacy and health education. Failures in health education have certainly contributed to poor health literacy, but the roots of the health literacy problems in this country are not just in the history of our system of education.  Health literacy problems have grown as patients are asked to assume more responsibility for self-care in a complex health care system.  Patients' health literacy, then, can be thought of as the currency needed to negotiate this complex system. Appropriate health literacy is also essential to health promotion, particularly as we address issues of primary prevention.  A health literate individual is more apt to know how to answer the question "How do I keep myself well?"  Adequate health literacy maybe of even greater importance in secondary prevention, as ineffective communication between health providers and patients can result in medical errors due to misinformation about medications and self-care instructions.

We have defined health literacy as "the degree to which individuals have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions."

According to the WHO, HL is ‘the cognitive and social skills which determine the motivation and ability of individuals to gain access to, understand, and use information in ways which promote and maintain good health.’ It also suggests that HL implies the achievement of a level of knowledge, personal skills, and confidence to take action to improve personal and community health by changing personal lifestyles and living conditions, and thus is critical to the empowerment of patients.

All of these definitions define HL as a quality of the individual, although Nutbeam [16](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5060442/#b16) referred to the population benefit of improving individuals’ HL. However, it should be noted that HL is based on the interaction of the individual’s skills with the demands of the society in which the individual lives, including health‐care providers, the health‐care system, the media and the community. [12](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5060442/#b12) Thus, an individual’s HL should be defined and assessed in relation to the ability of the society to communicate health information in a manner appropriate to the audience (i.e. the HL of the population).


## Measures of health literacy and related concepts

### Functional health literacy measures
Frequently used measures of functional HL are the Rapid Estimate of Adult Literacy (REALM) [10](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5060442/#b10) , the Test of Functional Health Literacy in Adults (TOFHLA), [11](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5060442/#b11) , and their abbreviated versions, REALM‐R [17](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5060442/#b17) and S‐TOFHLA [18](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5060442/#b18) .
Screening questions to identify patients with inadequate HL, including ‘How often do you have someone help you read hospital materials’, ‘How confident are you filling out medical forms by yourself’ and ‘How often do you have problems learning about your medical condition because of difficulty understanding written information?’ Based on this, the Single Item Literacy Screener (SILS) was developed to identify adults in need of help with printed health material by asking ‘How often do you need to have someone help you when you read instructions, pamphlets, or other written material from your doctor or pharmacy?’ [](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5060442/#b20)

### Communicative and critical health literacy measures
We found no validated instrument that has been created to assess communicative or critical HL for adults. 

For instance, the Perceived Efficacy in Patient–Physician Interactions (PEPPI) was developed to measure a patient’s self‐efficacy at obtaining medical information and attention to their medical concerns from physicians, [23](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5060442/#b23) and the Patient’s Confidence in Communication Scale (PCCS) was created to assess a patient’s ability to list goals, barriers and necessary skills for effective communication with the physician. The whole definition of communicative or critical HL, however, is not covered by any of the previously mentioned measures. Their focus is solely on the patient’s ability to communicate with health‐care providers (mainly physicians) and to make decisions in medical settings partly because patient–physician communication in the medical visit has been the most intensively studied area in health communication research. In addition, many of these measures are based on self‐reporting by patients in which patients are asked to rate their confidence or self‐efficacy, rather than their skills or ability, which departs from the definition of HL. In measuring HL based on a patient’s perception, the overlaps with existing constructs such as self‐efficacy and Health Locus of Control should be carefully considered. [22](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5060442/#b22)

Coding system applied to recorded communication between the patient and health‐care providers, such as the Roter Interaction Analysis Systems, [27](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5060442/#b27) whereas the skills in other settings, such as seeking and using information from mass media or the internet, may be more difficult to assess.

## Evidence from empirical studies
It has been widely acknowledged that limited literacy is associated with poor health status, even after controlling for potentially confounding sociodemographic variables such as income, education and ethnicity, and other factors. [28](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5060442/#b28) , [29](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5060442/#b29).


### Influence of functional health literacy on patient participation in health care
Limited functional HL is acknowledged to have negative impacts on various patient behaviours and health outcomes, including less knowledge of disease management and health‐promoting behaviours, poorer health status, less use of preventive services and a higher rate of hospitalization and emergency services use (for systematic reviews: [12](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5060442/#b12) , [30](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5060442/#b30) ).

#### Information seeking 
Numerous studies have reported the association between limited HL and poor knowledge and understanding of one’s health, disease, medications and treatments. [31](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5060442/#b31) , [32](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5060442/#b32) , [33](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5060442/#b33) , [34](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5060442/#b34)
