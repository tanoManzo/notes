The World Health Organization has defined HL as ‘the cognitive and social skills which determine the motivation and ability of individuals to gain access to, understand, and use information in ways which promote and maintain good health.’

Based on this definition, three levels of HL have been described: functional, communicative and critical.

Literature searches were conducted to identify studies of HL. We searched MEDLINE using ‘health literacy’ as a keyword and retrieved 371 articles published in English between 1985 and 2006. 

On the other hand, it has been noted that even individuals with adequate literacy might not have adequate HL because the literacy demands of the health‐care context is often more complex than that of everyday life. [](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5060442/#b12)

What is health literacy?  The term was first used in a 1974 paper titled Health education as social policy.3 In discussing health education as a policy issue affecting the health care system, the educational system, and mass communication, the author calls for minimum standards for "health literacy" for all school grade levels. This early use of the term shows there is a link between health literacy and health education. Failures in health education have certainly contributed to poor health literacy, but the roots of the health literacy problems in this country are not just in the history of our system of education.  Health literacy problems have grown as patients are asked to assume more responsibility for self-care in a complex health care system.  Patients' health literacy, then, can be thought of as the currency needed to negotiate this complex system.
