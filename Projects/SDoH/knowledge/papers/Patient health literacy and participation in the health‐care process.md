The World Health Organization has defined HL as ‘the cognitive and social skills which determine the motivation and ability of individuals to gain access to, understand, and use information in ways which promote and maintain good health.’

Based on this definition, three levels of HL have been described: functional, communicative and critical.

Literature searches were conducted to identify studies of HL. We searched MEDLINE using ‘health literacy’ as a keyword and retrieved 371 articles published in English between 1985 and 2006. 

On the other hand, it has been noted that even individuals with adequate literacy might not have adequate HL because the literacy demands of the health‐care context is often more complex than that of everyday life. [](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5060442/#b12)
