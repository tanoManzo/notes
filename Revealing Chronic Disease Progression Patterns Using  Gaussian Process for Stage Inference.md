Authors developed Gaussian Process for Stage Inference (GPSI) approach to uncover chronic disease progression patterns using synthetic and real-world data from several diseases.  

Slow progression and heterogeneous manifestations make it challenging to model the transition from normal to disease status. As patient conditions are only observed at discrete timestamps with varying intervals, an incomplete understanding of disease progression and heterogeneity affects clinical practice and drug development.

Our study demonstrated that an unsupervised approach can disentangle temporal and phenotypic heterogeneity and identify population subgroups with common patterns of disease progression. Based on the differences in these features across stages, physicians can better tailor treatment plans and medications to individual patients.


GPSI identified genotypes of based on image features, where these subgroups corresponded to different , indicating the bone-remodeling and overweighted-related pathways. 

Second, GPSI differentiated BP into two distinct developmental patterns and defined the contribution of specific brain region atrophy from early to advanced disease stages, demonstrating the ability of the GPSI to identify diagnostic subgroups. 

Third, HCC progression patterns were well reproduced in the two independent UTHealth and TCGA datasets.
