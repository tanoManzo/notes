Goal: the impact of social circumstances on cancer therapy
How: predict the prescription of targeted cancer therapy to patients based solely on documentation by clinical social workers.
What: a feature importance analysis to pinpoint the specific social circumstances that impact cancer therapy

Results: Using only social work notes, we consistently predicted the administration of targeted therapies, suggesting systematic differences in treatment selection exist due to non-clinical factors.
