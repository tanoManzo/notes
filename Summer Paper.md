## Main Questions 

### Question 1

- Detection of the motif of the TF matching the TF from ChIP-seq experiments. If you are unable to identify the expected motif, what are the reasons? 

- Would other tools (Borzoit, etc) be able to detect the motif? 

- How close is the motif located to the center of TF ChIP-seq peaks? 

- What is the percentage of ChIP-seq peaks with the detected motif? Comparing to the classical footprinting methods (ATAC-seq like), what is the resolution of your method?
