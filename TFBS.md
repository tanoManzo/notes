  
TFBS stands for Transcription Factor Binding Site. It refers to a specific DNA sequence motif where transcription factors (TFs) bind to regulate gene expression. Transcription factors are proteins that play a crucial role in controlling the [[transcription factor (TF) binding]] of genes by binding to these specific DNA sequences in the promoter or enhancer regions. Understanding TFBSs is crucial for unraveling the intricate network of gene regulation in cells. It provides insights into how transcription factors, by binding to specific DNA sequences, orchestrate the complex processes that control gene expression and cellular functions.
