## Abstract 
Closing the gap between measurable genetic information and observable traits is a longstanding challenge in genomics. 

We present an extensive study of foundation models pre-trained on DNA sequences, named the Nucleotide Transformer, integrating information from 3,202 diverse human genomes, as well as 850 genomes from a wide range of species, including model and non-model organisms.
