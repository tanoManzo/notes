## Abstract 
Closing the gap between measurable genetic information and observable traits is a longstanding challenge in genomics. 
1. We present an extensive study of foundation models pre-trained on DNA sequences, named the Nucleotide Transformer, integrating information from 3,202 diverse human genomes, as well as 850 genomes from a wide range of species, including model and non-model organisms. 
2. We show that the representations alone match or outperform specialized methods on 11 of 18 prediction tasks, and up to 15 after fine-tuning. Despite no supervision, the transformer models learnt to focus attention on key genomic elements, including those that regulate gene expression, such as enhancers. 
3. Finally, We demonstrate that utilizing model representations alone can improve the prioritization of functional genetic variants.
