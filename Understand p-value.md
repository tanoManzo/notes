p**-value**, short for **probability value**, measures how likely a result occurs through chance alone.

Throughout this course, we'll see that most statistical analysis boils down to these steps:

1. Form a **hypothesis**, which is an assumption made before experimentation.
    
2. Decide on a criterion that rejects the hypothesis if the experimental results are too unlikely.
    
3. Gather and analyze data, and then reject or don't reject the hypothesis based on the results.
