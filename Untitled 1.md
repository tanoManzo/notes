- **Allele-Specific Binding (ASB)**: Identifies SNPs that lead to differential binding of transcription factors (TFs) to DNA.
    
- **ChIP-seq Analysis**: Uses chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) to map ASB events across the genome.
    
- **Regulatory Impact**: ASB SNPs influence chromatin accessibility, histone modifications, and gene expression.
    
- **Disease Associations**: Many ASB SNPs overlap with genetic variants linked to complex diseases.
    
- **Mechanistic Insights**: Highlights how non-coding genetic variations affect TF binding and transcriptional regulation.
    
- **Functional Implications**: Provides a deeper understanding of how regulatory variants contribute to phenotypic diversity and disease risk.
