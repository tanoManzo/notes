Our DNA contains not only genes but also many non-coding regions that control when and where genes are active. Variants in these regulatory regions can lead to diseases, but it is often difficult to identify which ones are truly harmful. My research focuses on developing and applying advanced deep learning models to better predict how these genetic variants affect gene regulation.

I design deep learning models—including transformer-based architectures and hybrid approaches—and also compare existing state-of-the-art methods to understand their strengths and limitations. Using large experimental datasets that measure the impact of genetic variants on gene expression, I evaluate how accurately these models can identify variants that are likely to contribute to disease, including conditions like Parkinson's and ALS.

This work helps uncover how the non-coding genome influences health and disease and improves our ability to interpret genetic information in a biologically meaningful way.
