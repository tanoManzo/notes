**Motivation:** Transcription factors (TFs) control gene expression, and finding their binding sites is key to understanding gene regulation and how it changes in disease. Experimental footprinting methods are valuable but limited in scale, resolution, and cell-type coverage. Computational methods can scale up, but many act like black boxes, making predictions without clear biological meaning. This limits both insight and experimental follow-up. There is a need for methods that are accurate, interpretable, and biologically useful.

**Results:** We present a deep learning framework for TF footprinting that combines the predictive strength of the two-phase CNN-based TREDNet model with modern interpretation and motif discovery tools. TREDNet first learns sequence patterns and then refines predictions with genomic and epigenomic features, such as histone marks and chromatin accessibility. This two-phase design improves both accuracy and interpretability.

To explain the modelâ€™s predictions, we use DeepExplainer (SHAP) to create detailed attribution maps that show which sequence features drive the outputs. TF-MoDISco then groups these signals into motifs, giving biologically meaningful patterns. These motifs match known TF binding profiles and also highlight new regulatory signals, offering hypotheses for further study.

We apply the framework to enhancer regions in multiple cell lines and test how genetic variants change TF binding and regulatory activity. A key advantage of our approach is that it does not depend on TF-specific ChIP-seq data. This makes it possible to annotate regulatory elements and predict variant effects at large scale, even in contexts where experimental data are missing.

Our framework links deep learning with interpretable outputs, turning predictions into biological insight. It provides a practical tool for genome-wide regulatory annotation, variant effect prediction, and a deeper understanding of how TFs shape gene regulation.
