To the ISSNAF Young Investigator Award Committee,

I am writing to recommend Dr. Gaetano Manzo for the 2025 ISSNAF Young Investigator Award, Mario Gerla Award. I have supervised Gaetano at the National Institutes of Health from March 2024 to January 2025 during his postdoctoral fellowship, and I continue to work with him now as a Staff Scientist.

Gaetanoâ€™s research focuses on developing and adapting deep learning models for predicting the effects of regulatory variants in the human genome. He is a co-author of the preprint _Comparative Analysis of Deep Learning Models for Predicting Causative Regulatory Variants_ (Manzo, Borkowski, Ovcharenko, 2025), and he has ongoing work on models that combine nucleotide-resolution predictions with long-range sequence analysis. He has also contributed curated datasets and made his models publicly available.

During the summer of 2024, Gaetano co-supervised a summer intern, Kathryn Borkowski, who is a co-author on the preprint. He has demonstrated strong technical skills, particularly in adapting deep learning architectures from other fields, such as NLP, to genomic data. His work shows a careful, methodical approach to applying these methods in computational genomics.

I recommend Dr. Manzo for this award based on his research contributions, technical expertise, and commitment to advancing computational genomics.

Sincerely,

**Ivan Ovcharenko, Ph.D.**
