 She curated data such as chromatin profiles and transcription factor binding, ensuring quality for analysis. She implemented models like CNNs and RNNs to detect regulatory elements and developed methods to predict the effects of genetic variants. I evaluated model performance, visualized results, and derived biological insights.
