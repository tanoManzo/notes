Hello All,

I apologize for missing the meeting. I did not receive the notification and, for some reason, I thought it was at 4 PM. Holly updated me about it, and I also have some updates from a member of the George Town Canoe Club. I will share these updates with you in next Friday's meeting.

Enjoy the weekend, and once again, sorry for today.

Cheers,  
Gaetano Manzo
