The project aims to develop and optimize a transformer-based deep learning framework for detecting and assessing regulatory variants in the human genome, with a particular focus on non-coding regions that modulate gene expression. The proposed approach will extend beyond traditional CNN architectures by leveraging the transformer's ability to capture long-range dependencies and global context in sequence data. The summer intern will implement various optimization techniques, including architecture modifications, regularization methods, and knowledge distillation, to enhance the model's performance while maintaining computational efficiency. The framework will be trained on a sever dataset of chromatin profiles and regulatory annotations to predict cell-type-specific enhancer activities and quantify the impact of individual genetic variants1. Performance comparisons will be conducted against established CNN-based models, evaluating metrics such as prediction accuracy, computational efficiency, and ability to identify functional regulatory variants4. The project's outcomes will contribute to our understanding of genetic regulation and potentially aid in identifying disease-associated variants
