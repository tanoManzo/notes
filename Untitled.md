The project aims to develop and optimize a transformer-based deep learning framework for detecting and assessing regulatory variants in the human genome, with a particular focus on non-coding regions that modulate gene expression. The proposed approach will extend beyond traditional CNN architectures by leveraging the transformer's ability to capture long-range dependencies and global context in sequence data. The summer intern will implement various optimization techniques, including architecture modifications, regularization methods, and knowledge distillation, to enhance the model's performance while maintaining computational efficiency. The framework will be trained on a several dataset of chromatin profiles and regulatory annotations to predict cell-type-specific enhancer activities and quantify the impact of individual genetic variants. Performance comparisons will be conducted against established state-of-the-art models. The project's outcomes will contribute to our understanding of genetic regulation and potentially aid in identifying disease-associated variants
