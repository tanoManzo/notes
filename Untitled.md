Background[[M1]](#_msocom_1) [[MG([2]](#_msocom_2) : Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have linked many noncoding variants to complex traits and diseases, but distinguishing association from causation remains difficult. Deep learning models—particularly CNN- and Transformer-based architectures—are widely used for this task, yet comparisons are hindered by inconsistent benchmarks and evaluation practices. We aimed to establish a standardized assessment of leading models for predicting variant effects in enhancers and for prioritizing putative causal SNPs.
Methods: We evaluated state-of-the-art deep learning models under consistent training and evaluation conditions on nine datasets derived from MPRA, raQTL, and eQTL experiments. These datasets profile the regulatory impact of 54,859 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) across four human cell lines. Performance was compared for two related tasks: predicting the direction and magnitude of regulatory impact in enhancers and identifying likely causal SNPs within linkage disequilibrium (LD) blocks. We additionally assessed the effect of fine-tuning on Transformer-based models and the impact of Certainty in experimental results.  
Results: CNN models such as TREDNet and SEI performed best for predicting the regulatory impact of SNPs in enhancers. Hybrid CNN–Transformer models (e.g., Borzoi) performed best for causal variant prioritization within LD blocks. Fine-tuning benefits Transformers but remains insufficient to close the performance gap.
Conclusions: Under a unified benchmark, CNN architectures are most reliable for estimating enhancer regulatory effects of SNPs, while hybrid CNN–Transformer models are superior for causal SNP identification within LD. These standardized comparisons help guide model selection for variant-effect prediction in noncoding regions.
