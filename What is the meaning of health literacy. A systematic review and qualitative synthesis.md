[[SDoH]] [[Health Literacy]]

## Intro
Def: **Health literacy is defined as the ability of an individual to obtain and translate knowledge and information in order to maintain and improve health in a way that is appropriate to the individual and system contexts.  Proposed in the 1970s**

Inadequate health literacy is associated with difficulties in comprehension of health information, limited knowledge of diseases and lower medication adherence, which contribute to poor health, high risk of mortality, insufficient and ineffective use of healthcare, increased costs, and health disparities.

The WHO recommends health literacy as an instrument for achieving several key targets listed in the Sustainable Development Goals.[15](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7239702/#R15) The existing evidence seems to suggest health literacy as one of the most promising and cost-effective approaches to overcome the non-communicable diseases (NCD) challenges.

This study aimed to clarify ‘what health literacy represents’ through a systematic review and qualitative synthesis of existing studies across different contexts in relation to this complex concept.

For example, Freedman _et al_[22](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7239702/#R22) interpreted health literacy as ‘the skills necessary to obtain, process, evaluate, and act upon information needed to make public health decisions that benefit the community’.

## What is health literacy? 

Health literacy was commonly conceptualized as a set of knowledge, a set of skills or a hierarchy of functions (functional-interactive-critical).

Four studies highlighted knowledge as the core: declarative knowledge, procedural knowledge and judgement skills (Schulz and Nakamoto[25](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7239702/#R25)). 

- Declarative knowledge represents people’s understanding of factual information about health.
- Procedural knowledge represents people’s understanding of rules that guide people’s reasoned choices and actions.
