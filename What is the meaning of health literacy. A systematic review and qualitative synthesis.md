[[SDoH]] [[Health Literacy]]

## Intro
Def: **Health literacy is defined as the ability of an individual to obtain and translate knowledge and information in order to maintain and improve health in a way that is appropriate to the individual and system contexts.  Proposed in the 1970s**

Inadequate health literacy is associated with difficulties in comprehension of health information, limited knowledge of diseases and lower medication adherence, which contribute to poor health, high risk of mortality, insufficient and ineffective use of healthcare, increased costs, and health disparities.

The WHO recommends health literacy as an instrument for achieving several key targets listed in the Sustainable Development Goals.[15](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7239702/#R15) The existing evidence seems to suggest health literacy as one of the most promising and cost-effective approaches to overcome the non-communicable diseases (NCD) challenges.

This study aimed to clarify ‘what health literacy represents’ through a systematic review and qualitative synthesis of existing studies across different contexts in relation to this complex concept.

For example, Freedman _et al_[22](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7239702/#R22) interpreted health literacy as ‘the skills necessary to obtain, process, evaluate, and act upon information needed to make public health decisions that benefit the community’.

## What is health literacy? 

### Set of knowledge 
Health literacy was commonly conceptualized as a set of knowledge, a set of skills or a hierarchy of functions (functional-interactive-critical). Four studies highlighted knowledge as the core: declarative knowledge, procedural knowledge and judgement skills (Schulz and Nakamoto[25](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7239702/#R25)). 

- Declarative knowledge represents people’s understanding of factual information about health.
- Procedural knowledge represents people’s understanding of rules that guide people’s reasoned choices and actions.

Paakkari and Paakkari[38](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7239702/#R38) argued that self-awareness and citizenship also form a part of health literacy because they represent one’s ability to assess oneself in an informed way and to take responsibility to improve health beyond a personal perspective. Rowlands _et al_[24](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7239702/#R24) found that health literacy is reflected in people’s ability to acquire, understand and evaluate knowledge for health. Shreffler-Grant _et al_[37](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7239702/#R37) specified the knowledge regarding the dosage, effect, safety and availability of medicines as health literacy associated with complementary medicines.


### Communication Skills
The Institute of Medicine (IoM) presented one of the most influential models of health literacy. The IoM model contains four underlying constructs: cultural and conceptual knowledge, print health literacy (writing and reading skills), oral health literacy (listening and speaking), and numeracy.[4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7239702/#R4)Harrington and Valerio[35](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7239702/#R35) refined details of verbal exchange of health information, similar to the concept of oral health literacy. Yip[50](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7239702/#R50) argued that speaking, reading, writing, listening and numeracy are particularly important for people with limited English proficiency. Squiers _et al_[19](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7239702/#R19) added negotiation skills into oral health literacy and relabeled it as communication skills. Sørensen _et al_ summarized the literature and presented skills to access, understand, appraise and apply information and knowledge as four core skills of health literacy, which can cover all related works that people need to carry on when dealing with health information to improve and maintain health.[5](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7239702/#R5)

### hierarchy of functions
Several studies viewed health literacy as a hierarchy of functions, which require different levels of social and cognitive skills. Nutbeam[3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7239702/#R3) first proposed the three-level model: functional health literacy, interactive health literacy and critical health literacy.
In Nutbeam’s prototypical model, functional health literacy refers to ‘basic skills in reading and writing to enable individuals to function effectively in everyday situations’; interactive health literacy covers ‘more advanced skills to extract information and derive meaning from different forms of communication, and to apply new information to change circumstances’; critical health literacy requires ‘the highest-level of skills to critically analyse and use information to exert greater control over life events and situations’. **Chinn[34](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7239702/#R34) considered critical health literacy as the function of understanding social determinants of health and engaging in collective actions.**

### Other Perspective 
Soellner _et al_[23](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7239702/#R23) proposed addition of self-perception, proactive approach to health, self-regulation and self-control into the concept of health literacy. By contrast, Jordan _et al_[26](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7239702/#R26) examined the views of patients and proposed three dimensions of health literacy: identifying a health issue (knowing when and where to find health information), engaging in information exchange (verbal communication skills, assertiveness and literacy skills) and acting on health information (capacity to process and retain information, and application skills).

Buchbinder _et al_[20](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7239702/#R20) combined the views from both patients and health professionals and summarised health literacy as knowledge, attitude, attribute, relationship, skills, actions and context in relation to 16 aspects such as diseases, health systems, information and others. Several studies emphasised some special elements critical to a particular population: for example, consistency, delivery and contents of information for sexual health of gay men[48](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7239702/#R48); self-management skills and active involvement in consultations for patients with chronic diseases[44](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7239702/#R44); relationships and support systems for cancer caregivers[49](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7239702/#R49); patient–provider relationship and preventive care (indicating a proactive approach to health); and the rights and responsibilities (capturing principles of self-efficacy and empowerment to manage one’s health environment) for adolescents.[39](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7239702/#R39)

### Elements of health literacy

#### Knowledge of health, health care and health systems 
The theme of knowledge refers to the understanding of factual information about health and can be further divided into four aspects, namely knowledge of medicine, knowledge of health, knowledge of health systems and knowledge of science.[4 20 22 23 25 31 34 36–39 42–44 49](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7239702/#R4)
Knowledge of medicine refers to the understanding of information under the medical context, such as medications, treatments and illness states, while knowledge of health is focused on understanding information in regard to health under everyday situations, for example, healthy behaviors, healthy lifestyle, health terms and public health. Knowledge of healthcare systems refers to the understanding of information about the basic structure and available services of a health system, which helps people use the system in a more effective and efficient way. Finally, knowledge of science refers to the understanding of fundamental scientific concepts and scientific arguments.


#### Processing and using information in various formats in relation to health and healthcare 
This theme concerns whether people are able to process and use information in relation to health and healthcare effectively. It can be further divided into four subthemes: ability to process and use information to guide health actions, self-efficacy in processing and using health information, provision of health information (active engagement in dissemination of consistent information in a language that is appropriate to consumers), and access to resources and support for processing information.
