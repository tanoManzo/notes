R-squared is not only the reduction in mean squared error (MSE), but also **the square of correlation**. The correlation of weight and bill depth is 0.58. Squaring that, we get 0.33, which is the R-squared value we found earlier.

**As correlation approaches 1, or increases, so does R-squared. Higher correlation corresponds with larger reductions in MSE.**
