The term "histone marks" refers to post-translational modifications (PTMs) that occur on histone proteins, which are crucial components of chromatin. Histones play a central role in packaging DNA into a compact structure within the cell nucleus. Post-translational modifications of histones can alter the chromatin structure, influencing gene expression and other cellular processes.
