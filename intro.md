Regulatory elements, such as enhancers, play a critical role in orchestrating gene expression, ensuring precise spatial and temporal control necessary for development, homeostasis, and adaptation. Variants in these non-coding regions have emerged as key contributors to phenotypic diversity and disease susceptibility. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have revolutionized our understanding of genetic contributions to complex traits, revealing that over 90% of disease-associated variants lie within non-coding regions, particularly enhancers. These findings underscore the importance of regulatory variation in modulating gene expression and linking genetic changes to organismal phenotypes
