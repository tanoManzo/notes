Regulatory elements, such as enhancers, play a critical role in orchestrating gene expression, ensuring precise spatial and temporal control necessary for development, homeostasis, and adaptation. Variants in these non-coding regions have emerged as key contributors to phenotypic diversity and disease susceptibility. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have revolutionized our understanding of genetic contributions to complex traits, revealing that over 90% of disease-associated variants lie within non-coding regions, particularly enhancers. These findings underscore the importance of regulatory variation in modulating gene expression and linking genetic changes to organismal phenotypes

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have revealed that the majority of disease-associated genetic variants occur in non-coding regions of the genome, particularly within regulatory elements that modulate gene expression~\cite{uffelmann2021gwas, visscher2017ten, knight2014approaches}.Â These regulatory variants can have profound effects on phenotypes and disease susceptibility by altering the complex mechanisms that control when, where, and how much genes are expressed~\cite{albert2015regulatory}. 


These models not only prioritize candidate causal variants but also reveal the molecular mechanisms by which these variants influence gene regulation. 


By integrating statistical fine-mapping with deep learning predictions, researchers have identified variants that likely contribute to complex traits and diseases, underscoring the utility of these approaches in understanding the genetic basis of human phenotypes
