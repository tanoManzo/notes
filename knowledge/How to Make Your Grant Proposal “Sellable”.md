Convince your reviewers that the outcome of your study will provide a solution to a _critical need_ within the community. 

In particular, Dr. Robertson placed emphasis on the two most important sections of the grant: the specific aims page and the innovation section. The specific aims page is equivalent to an advertisement for your research; whether the reviewers decide to read the rest of your proposal hinges on the impression you make in this section. You need to pose your question (_critical need_) clearly and propose a _novel solution_ to this need to show you have something special to offer. It is imperative that the specific aims page contains everything important about the project, but without a lot of detail.

## The Specific Aims Page
![[Pasted image 20230515144150.png]]
Dr. Robertson laid out the essentials for a strong specific aims section, listed as follows:

1.  Introductory paragraph, including knowns and unknowns (the gap in knowledge)
2.  Central hypothesis and rationale
3.  Aims (specific aims/goals)
4.  Payoff paragraph consisting of expectations and positive impact

In the introductory paragraph, it is best to use a “hook” sentence to generate interest in the proposal. This section should also address what the proposal will be about and how it relates to the mission of the funding agency, but avoid stating information that is obvious to any reviewer. For example, if your research is cancer-related, do not write “Cancer is the second leading cause of death in the world.” This statement fails to present new information or introduce what the grant proposes.

Do not assume reviewers will know why your work is important; clearly define a critical need—the driving force for the proposal. 

The second paragraph should present an objective that addresses the critical need identified in the first paragraph and a testable central hypothesis. This paragraph also contains the long-term goals. At this point, check that the objective matches the critical need you identified. The primary purpose of this paragraph is to convince the reviewers that you (and your team) have the _fix_ to the _problem_ identified in first paragraph.

The third paragraph comprises a logical step-by-step plan to address the critical need. This is commonly known as the specific aims. The best way to accomplish this is to have two to three headline statements that are _conceptual rather than descriptive._

**Conceptual aim**: “Identify the active component of _G. jasminoides_ extracts responsible for wound healing.”

The fourth paragraph serves to highlight the “payoffs” of the study, emphasizing why this would be of value to the funding agency. Begin this paragraph with _expected_ _outcomes_ (e.g., We expect to have determined), which must be specific and credible. For K awards, use singular first person pronoun (i.e., “I” instead of “we”). The final statement in this paragraph should be of positive impact, basically, how the outcomes will meet the need and advance the mission of the agency.

## The Research Strategy

The Research Strategy follows the Specific Aims page and consists of three subsections

1.  Significance
2.  Innovation
3.  Approach

While the significance and approach subsections may seem easy to develop (after all, that is what we just covered for the specific aims page), Dr. Robertson said the two most common mistakes made by applicants are “insufficient justification for the significance of the proposal” and “including too few details about proposed studies.”

The middle subsection on Innovation follows significance and should be about one-third to one-half of a page. This section is different from the significance section in that significance is a positive effect of the study while innovation refers to a new and substantially different way of answering an NIH-relevant problem.

While writing the innovation section, document the existing strategies, state their limitations, and then use the italicized statement, “The proposed research is innovative, in our opinion, because…” Next, summarize the advancements that may become possible with your innovative new approach.
