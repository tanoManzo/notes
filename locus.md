locus

In genetics, a locus (plural: loci) refers to a specific location on a chromosome where a particular gene or DNA sequence is found.
 * Each locus contains one or more alleles, which are different forms of a gene.
 * The alleles at a locus determine the traits expressed by an organism.
 * Loci are inherited in pairs, with one copy coming from each parent.
 * The position of a locus on a chromosome is constant, although it may vary slightly between different individuals or species.
> 
> **Types of Loci:**
> 
> * **Autosomal loci:** Located on non-sex chromosomes (chromosomes 1-22 in humans).
> * **Sex-linked loci:** Located on the X or Y chromosomes.
> * **Mitochondrial loci:** Located in the mitochondrial DNA, which is inherited only from the mother.
> 
> **Importance of Loci:**
> 
> * Understanding loci is essential for genetic mapping, which helps identify the location of genes responsible for specific traits or diseases.
> * Mutations at loci can alter gene function and lead to genetic disorders.
> * Linkage studies can determine the relative distances between loci and help construct genetic maps.
> * Genetic testing can analyze loci to diagnose genetic disorders and predict disease risk.
> 
> **Related Concepts:**
> 
> * **Gene:** A functional unit of DNA that codes for a specific protein or RNA molecule.
> * **Allele:** Different forms of a gene that occur at a specific locus.
> * **Chromosome:** A long, thread-like structure made of DNA that carries genes.

DNA profiling today is based on a method very similar to the technique first proposed in 1985.

Since then, genome sequencing advances have allowed us to use PCR to zero in on highly variable loci where much of the human sequence diversity can be found.

These short loci are called **microsatellites** and vary significantly in length between people, so only a few need to be monitored to generate a statistically strong genetic profile. Microsatellites consist of many short tandem repeats, which usually consist of two to four nucleotide sequences repeated around 5−20 times. Mutations in these regions do not occur as SNPs, but instead the replication machinery “slips” or “stutters” while replicating the repetitive region and results in different numbers of repeats. These types of repetitive regions in the human genome do not usually encode for a protein, and serve an as-yet unknown purpose.
