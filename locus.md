DNA profiling today is based on a method very similar to the technique first proposed in 1985.

Since then, genome sequencing advances have allowed us to use PCR to zero in on highly variable loci where much of the human sequence diversity can be found.

These short loci are called **microsatellites** and vary significantly in length between people, so only a few need to be monitored to generate a statistically strong genetic profile. Microsatellites consist of many short tandem repeats, which usually consist of two to four nucleotide sequences repeated around 5−20 times. Mutations in these regions do not occur as SNPs, but instead the replication machinery “slips” or “stutters” while replicating the repetitive region and results in different numbers of repeats. These types of repetitive regions in the human genome do not usually encode for a protein, and serve an as-yet unknown purpose.
