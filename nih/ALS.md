ALS (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis), also known as Lou Gehrig's disease, is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that affects nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord.

| **Aspect**       | **Details**                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Symptoms**     | ALS leads to muscle weakness, atrophy, and eventual paralysis. Early symptoms often include muscle twitching, cramping, stiffness, or weakness, particularly in the arms and legs.             |
| **Cause**        | The exact cause is unknown in most cases. About 10% of cases are familial, linked to mutations in specific genes; the rest are sporadic, with complex genetic and environmental contributions. |
| **Diagnosis**    | Diagnosis is primarily clinical, based on symptoms and disease progression, supported by electromyography (EMG) and nerve conduction studies (NCS).                                            |
| **Treatment**    | There is no cure. Approved treatments like Riluzole and Edaravone can modestly slow disease progression, but supportive care remains central.                                                  |
| **Prevalence**   | ALS is rare. In the U.S., prevalence is 9.1 per 100,000 population (2018 data), with an estimated 32,893 cases in 2022 and projections of over 36,000 by 2030.                                 |
| **Prognosis**    | Average life expectancy after diagnosis is 2–5 years, though some individuals, such as Stephen Hawking, live much longer.                                                                      |
| **Famous Cases** | Lou Gehrig (baseball player) and Stephen Hawking (physicist) are among the most well-known individuals with ALS.                                                                               |

## Epidemiology and Prevalence

- **U.S. Prevalence:** 9.1 per 100,000 people (2018), with approximately 33,000 cases in 2022 and projections exceeding 36,000 by 2030.
- **Demographics:** ALS disproportionately affects Whites, males, and those over age 50.

---

## Genetics and GWAS Findings

- **GWAS Studies:** As of 2025, the GWAS Catalog lists 44 genome-wide association studies (GWAS) on ALS, primarily in European populations.
- **Risk Loci:** The largest GWAS to date identified 15 risk loci associated with ALS susceptibility.
- **GWAS SNPs:** There are 353 genome-wide significant SNP associations for ALS reported in the GWAS Catalog.
- **Genetic Architecture:** Both common and rare variants contribute to ALS risk. About 10% of cases are familial, often with identifiable mutations (e.g., C9orf72, SOD1, KIF5A), while sporadic cases show complex heritability (estimated at 40–50%).

### ALS GWAS Data Summary

| Metric                         | Value   |
| ------------------------------ | ------- |
| Number of GWAS studies         | 44      |
| Number of significant SNPs     | 353     |
| Number of risk loci identified | 15      |

## Additional Notes

- **Lifetime Risk:** ALS has a lifetime risk of about 1 in 350 people.
- **Incidence:** In the U.S., the annual incidence is about 1.6–2 per 100,000 people.
- **Prognosis:** Most patients die within 3–5 years due to respiratory failure, but survival varies.

### Early-Stage ALS Symptoms

- **Muscle twitching and cramps:** Often in the hands, arms, or legs (fasciculations).
- **Weakness:** Asymmetric limb weakness (e.g., difficulty gripping objects, stumbling).
- **Bulbar symptoms:** Slurred speech or swallowing difficulties (less common in early stages).
- **Fatigue and stiffness:** Increased muscle tone and reduced coordination.

**Age of Onset:**
- **Typical:** 40–70 years (average ~55 years).
- **Early-onset:** ~5% of cases before age 40; rare cases in 20s/30s.
- **Familial ALS:** Often diagnosed in late 40s/early 50s.
- **Sporadic ALS:** Typically diagnosed in late 50s/early 60s.

The GWAS also confirmed five previously identified ALS risk genes:
- **TNP1**
- **C9ORF72**
- **TBK1**
- **UNC13A**
- **C21ORF2**


## C9orf72-ALS

When comparing mutation rates of known ALS genes, _C9orf72_ repeat expansions occurred one to two times more frequently than _SOD1_ mutations, together explaining 18%–50% of familial ALS patients ([Smith et al. 2013](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5880162/#A026757C114); [Stewart et al. 2012](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5880162/#A026757C117)). Nevertheless, especially in ALS, in which family history is observed in only 10% of patients, sporadic ALS patients who carry an expanded repeat outnumber familial ALS patients. It is important to note that the frequency of _C9orf72_ G4C2 hexanucleotide repeat expansions greatly depends on ethnicity and geographical region. Globally, frequencies are the highest in the Caucasian populations of Europe and North America, ranging from 7% to 28% in ALS, 3.5% to 18% in FTLD, and 15% to more than 50% in ALS-FTD ([Cruts et al. 2013](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5880162/#A026757C28)). In European populations, frequencies were markedly elevated in ALS patients from Scandinavian countries ([Majounie et al. 2012](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5880162/#A026757C79); [Lindquist et al. 2013](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5880162/#A026757C74); [Smith et al. 2013](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5880162/#A026757C114); [van der Zee et al. 2013](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5880162/#A026757C130)). In strong contrast, pathological repeat expansions were rarely observed in Asian populations, with frequencies of 0.4%–4.8% in ALS cases ([Majounie et al. 2012](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5880162/#A026757C79); [Tsai et al. 2012](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5880162/#A026757C123); [Jang et al. 2013](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5880162/#A026757C60); [Konno et al. 2013](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5880162/#A026757C66); [Zou et al. 2013](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5880162/#A026757C146)).
