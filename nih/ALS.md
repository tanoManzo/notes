ALS (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis), also known as Lou Gehrig's disease, is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that affects nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord.

| **Aspect**       | **Details**                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Symptoms**     | ALS leads to muscle weakness, atrophy, and eventual paralysis. Early symptoms often include muscle twitching, cramping, stiffness, or weakness, particularly in the arms and legs.             |
| **Cause**        | The exact cause is unknown in most cases. About 10% of cases are familial, linked to mutations in specific genes; the rest are sporadic, with complex genetic and environmental contributions. |
| **Diagnosis**    | Diagnosis is primarily clinical, based on symptoms and disease progression, supported by electromyography (EMG) and nerve conduction studies (NCS).                                            |
| **Treatment**    | There is no cure. Approved treatments like Riluzole and Edaravone can modestly slow disease progression, but supportive care remains central.                                                  |
| **Prevalence**   | ALS is rare. In the U.S., prevalence is 9.1 per 100,000 population (2018 data), with an estimated 32,893 cases in 2022 and projections of over 36,000 by 2030.                                 |
| **Prognosis**    | Average life expectancy after diagnosis is 2–5 years, though some individuals, such as Stephen Hawking, live much longer.                                                                      |
| **Famous Cases** | Lou Gehrig (baseball player) and Stephen Hawking (physicist) are among the most well-known individuals with ALS.                                                                               |

## Epidemiology and Prevalence

- **U.S. Prevalence:** 9.1 per 100,000 people (2018), with approximately 33,000 cases in 2022 and projections exceeding 36,000 by 2030.
- **Demographics:** ALS disproportionately affects Whites, males, and those over age 50.

---

## Genetics and GWAS Findings

- **GWAS Studies:** As of 2025, the GWAS Catalog lists 44 genome-wide association studies (GWAS) on ALS, primarily in European populations.
- **Risk Loci:** The largest GWAS to date identified 15 risk loci associated with ALS susceptibility.
- **GWAS SNPs:** There are 353 genome-wide significant SNP associations for ALS reported in the GWAS Catalog.
- **Genetic Architecture:** Both common and rare variants contribute to ALS risk. About 10% of cases are familial, often with identifiable mutations (e.g., C9orf72, SOD1, KIF5A), while sporadic cases show complex heritability (estimated at 40–50%).

### ALS GWAS Data Summary

| Metric                         | Value   |
| ------------------------------ | ------- |
| Number of GWAS studies         | 44      |
| Number of significant SNPs     | 353     |
| Number of risk loci identified | 15      |

## Additional Notes

- **Lifetime Risk:** ALS has a lifetime risk of about 1 in 350 people.
- **Incidence:** In the U.S., the annual incidence is about 1.6–2 per 100,000 people.
- **Prognosis:** Most patients die within 3–5 years due to respiratory failure, but survival varies.

### Early-Stage ALS Symptoms

- **Muscle twitching and cramps:** Often in the hands, arms, or legs (fasciculations).
- **Weakness:** Asymmetric limb weakness (e.g., difficulty gripping objects, stumbling).
- **Bulbar symptoms:** Slurred speech or swallowing difficulties (less common in early stages).
- **Fatigue and stiffness:** Increased muscle tone and reduced coordination.

**Age of Onset:**
- **Typical:** 40–70 years (average ~55 years).
- **Early-onset:** ~5% of cases before age 40; rare cases in 20s/30s.
- **Familial ALS:** Often diagnosed in late 40s/early 50s.
- **Sporadic ALS:** Typically diagnosed in late 50s/early 60s.

The GWAS also confirmed five previously identified ALS risk genes:
- **TNP1**
- **C9ORF72**
- **TBK1**
- **UNC13A**
- **C21ORF2**


## C9orf72-ALS: Genetic, Epidemiological, and Clinical Insights

### **Genetic Overview**
- **Mutation Type:** Hexanucleotide repeat expansion (HRE) in the *C9orf72* gene, typically involving hundreds to thousands of GGGGCC repeats.
- **Inheritance:** Autosomal dominant with incomplete penetrance. Penetrance increases with age, rarely manifesting before 35 years[2][9].
- **Founder Effect:** Originated from a single haplotype ~1,500–6,300 years ago, explaining its high prevalence in European populations[2][9].

### **Global Prevalence and Ethnic Variation**
| **Population**       | **Familial ALS** | **Sporadic ALS** | **Sporadic FTD** |
|-----------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|
| **Europe/N. America** | 20%–86%[9]       | 6%–8%[1][3][7]  | 3%–6%[1][9]     |
| **Hispanic (USA)**    | -                | 8.3%[1]         | -                |
| **African (USA)**     | -                | 4.1%[1]         | -                |
| **Asian**             | 0%–4.8%[4][9]   | 0.4%–5%[4][9]   | Rare[4]         |

- **Regional Highlights:**
  - **Scandinavia:** Highest familial ALS rates (72%–86%)[9].
  - **Japan:** 0.4% of sporadic ALS cases carry *C9orf72* mutations[4].
  - **India/Pacific Islands:** No reported cases in sporadic ALS[1][4].

---

### **Clinical Features**
- **Phenotypes:** 
  - Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)
  - Frontotemporal dementia (FTD)
  - ALS-FTD overlap (30%–50% of carriers)[5][8].
- **Survival:** Similar to typical ALS (2–5 years post-diagnosis), though some reports suggest prolonged survival in subsets[9].
- **Non-Motor Symptoms:** Psychiatric/cognitive changes (e.g., disinhibition, apathy) often precede motor symptoms[5].

---

### **Genetic Architecture and Mechanisms**
- **Pathogenesis:** 
  - **Toxic gain-of-function:** RNA foci and dipeptide repeats disrupt cellular processes[8].
  - **Haploinsufficiency:** Reduced *C9orf72* expression may contribute to neurodegeneration[8].
- **Haplotype Instability:** The ancestral risk haplotype predisposes to repeat expansion due to inherent genomic instability[9].

---

### **Epidemiology in Key Populations**
- **U.S. Estimates (2020):** 
  - **Prevalent Cases:** 4,545 (26% familial, 74% sporadic)[3].
  - **Incident Cases:** 1,706 annually[3].
- **Europe:** Accounts for 46% of familial ALS and 8% of sporadic ALS cases[9].

---

### **Implications for Diagnosis and Research**
- **Testing Recommendations:** 
  - Prioritize *C9orf72* testing in all ALS/FTD patients, regardless of family history[6][7].
  - **Clinical Trials:** Target *C9orf72* due to its high contribution (up to 75% of pathogenic variants in U.S. cohorts)[5].
- **Challenges:** 
  - Family history underestimates genetic burden (74% of *C9orf72*-ALS cases are sporadic)[3][6].
  - Non-penetrance complicates genetic counseling[4][9].
