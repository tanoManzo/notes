1. Progress toward meeting training plan and accomplishments:

Dr. Manzo has acquired much background knowledge needed for the CLARIN project in order to automatically detect caregivers' attitude from clinical notes. He has contributed in deeper the understanding of the MIMIC-III clinical notes discovering patterns and inconsistency in the data to be addressed. He has contributed to deliver the annotated dateset, which he implemented the annotation tool, necessary for the success of the project.
