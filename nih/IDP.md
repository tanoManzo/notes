[[NIH Training]]

1. Progress toward meeting training plan and accomplishments:
Dr. Manzo has acquired substantial background knowledge required for the CLARIN project, focusing on automatically detecting caregivers' attitudes from clinical notes. His contributions have led to a deeper understanding of the MIMIC-III clinical notes, wherein he has identified patterns and inconsistencies within the data. He successfully developed and implemented an annotation tool for creating the annotated dataset crucial for the project's success. Additionally, Dr. Manzo has been actively engaged in the implementation and testing of various large language models aimed at detecting specific attitude patterns. Lastly, he has participated in numerous meetings and training sessions to guide and shape the trajectory of his ongoing research endeavors.


2. Publications:
Dr. Manzo published a conference paper at the American Medical Informatics Association (AMIA) 2023, titled: "Caregivers Attitude Detection From Clinical Notes."

3. Research and training objectives for the next year:
Dr. Manzo will persist in his efforts on the CLARIN project, delving into caregivers' trajectories, examining diverse ICUs such as TSICU and MICU, and broadening the scope of model selection.
Simultaneously, he will conduct parallel research by investigating Health Literacy within clinical notes. He plans to deploy language models to identify patients with inadequate health literacy and ascertain whether any distinctive patterns emerge within this subgroup.


4. Career plans and mentoring activities for fellow:
From the aforementioned research, Dr. Manzo is expected to publicize his results in at least two publications. He should also be able to participate in some of the Research Fellows events here at NIH. There should be a number of other papers coming out of our assembly comparison studies that Dr. Manzo should be able to contribute to and thereby be included as a co-author. Concluding his endeavors, Dr. Manzo aims to submit a K99 grant proposal, which is anticipated to influence and shape his career.
