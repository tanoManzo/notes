On chromosome 11, the SNP with the lowest p-value (rs10767971; p = 5.4 × 10-7) lies between the genes _QSER1_ and _PRRG4_. Near the PARK3 linkage region on chromosome 2p13, association was observed with a SNP (rs7577851; p = 8.7 × 10-6) which lies in an intron of the _AAK1_ gene. This gene is closely related to _GAK_, identified as a possible PD susceptibility gene in the GWAS of the familial PD cases.
