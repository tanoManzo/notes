We found two genome-wide significant association signals, one at SNCA and the other a protein-coding variant in TMEM175, both of which are known PD risk loci and a Bonferroni corrected significant effect at other known PD risk loci, GBA, INPP5F/BAG3, FAM47E/SCARB2, and MCCC1. Notably, SNCA, TMEM175

### SNCA locus

- rs356203 (end of 3' of SNCA gene)
- correlation between rs356203 and rs6532192 (secondary signal at 5' end of the SNCA gene)
