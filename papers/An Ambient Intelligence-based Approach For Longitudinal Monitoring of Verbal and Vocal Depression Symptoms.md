Depression affects not only a personâ€™s mood but also their speech patterns. Individuals with depression may exhibit changes in speech, such as slower speech rate, longer pauses, reduced pitch variability, and decreased overall speech fluency. 

To overcome these issues, we propose a one-shot learning framework for detecting depression relapse from speech. We define depression relapse as the similarity between the speech audio and textual encoding of a subject and that of a depressed individual. To detect depression relapse based on this definition, we employ a Siamese neural network that models the similarity between of two instances.
