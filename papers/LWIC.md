The core logic of Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) comes from decades of scientific research demonstrating that people’s language can provide extremely rich insights into their psychological states, including their emotions, thinking styles, and social concerns. Sometimes, these insights are fairly obvious and straight-forward. For example, if someone is using a lot of words like _happy_, _excited_, and _elated_, they are probably feeling happy, and we can use this information to reliably estimate their current emotional state. Oftentimes, however, the relationships between verbal behavior and psychology are much, much less obvious. For example, people who are more confident and higher in social standings tend to use "you" words at relatively high rates, and "me" words at relatively low rates. Here, too, decades of empirical research — particularly research using LIWC as a scientific instrument — provides us with specialized ways of understanding, explaining, and quantifying psychological, social, and behavioral phenomena.
