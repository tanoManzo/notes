The ORHIEDS project aims at providing and further developing the Human Intracerebral EEG platform (HIP), an innovative open-source, GDPR-compliant, cloud-based infrastructure to leverage the re-use and sharing of an invaluable and scarce type of health data i.e. intracerebral electroencephalography (iEEG) recordings from persons with drug resistant focal epilepsy. 

ORHIEDS addresses two much broader objectives:

1) iEEG data enable not only to perform advanced research in the field of epilepsy, but also offer a unique source of information to study and understand human brain functions at large, and thus progress in the field of brain health in general; 

2) the innovative technical characteristics of the HIP, in particular its capacity to offer end-users a desktop-like experience for curating, sharing and analysing sensitive data, while ensuring optimal data privacy and safety, can be extended to any other research domains.
Conversely, by using the HIP, iEEG centers can share: 
1) data, increasing the available sample size, 
2) workflows and softwares to harmonize the re-usable data to improve their analyses, and 
3) new research hypotheses to advance research collaboratively.

Section 1: 
EEG recordings [12]. These are invasive investigations for which objectives are to provide more precise information regarding the localization of the epileptogenic zone [13]. 
During the last decade, most epilepsy centers have progressively shifted to using intracerebral rather than subdural electrodes, using the so-called stereo-electroencephalography (SEEG) [14]. 
A significant proportion of patients continue to have seizures following SEEG and epilepsy surgery, indicating that our current iEEG biomarkers of the epileptogenic zone are suboptimal. Accordingly, a very active area of research aims at validating more performant iEEG biomarkers than those currently available, a topic which could greatly benefit from enhanced iEEG data sharing.

**However, the sampling rate of iEEG recordings in clinical settings is most often ≤ 1024 Hz, limiting the availability of appropriate iEEG data to study VHFOs Hz. Another general issue in the field has been the heterogeneity of the methods used to detect and analyze HFOs, as well as the insufficient level of data sharing and open data, hampering reproducibility of findings.
One of the three scientific use-cases of ORHIEDS will aim at tackling these issues by providing through the Human Intracerebral EEG platform (HIP), access to well curated iEEG data, appropriate for the study of VHFOs, and shared workflows for their analysis. This use-case shall help to advance the field of HFOs and epilepsy surgery outcome.**

Section 2:
To understand the neural mechanisms of attention, the importance of data with subsecond time resolution cannot be over-emphasized. For instance, Menon and Uddin [42] explicitly acknowledged that a complete dissociation between bottom–up (saliency) and top–down (control) attentional signals requires access to temporal dynamics on the 30–70-ms time scale. A second scientific use-case of ORHIEDS aims at leveraging the field of iEEG-based cognitive research by showcasing the
possibility to organize such a research project at a multicentric level, with the capacity to on-board through the HIP platform, many stakeholders to collect, curate and analyze harmonized cognition-triggered iEEG data. The use-case will be to investigate the neural network underlying attention. 


Section 3:
However, this seizure type only represents less than 15% of all
seizures. Detecting other seizure types, and in particular focal seizures, represents a much
greater technological challenge, due to a large variety of clinical patterns and less dramatic
ictal signs than those occurring during GTCS. This endeavour would benefit from investigating
the fine correlations between the involvement of the CAN during seizures and changes in
peripheral autonomic activity. Finally, GTCS-triggered cardio-respiratory dysfunctions are
known to play a primary role in the mechanisms leading to sudden unexpected death in
epilepsy (SUDEP), a tragic outcome affecting persons of old age suffering from epilepsy,
including children and young adults. Here again, a better understanding of seizure-induced
alterations of the CAN could help develop novel interventions to prevent SUDEP
The third scientific use-case of ORHIEDS aims at collecting, curating and sharing an harmonized
dataset including iEEG and autonomic data, including EKG and SpO2 available in most patients, and wrist-recorded EDA, PPG and 3D-accelerometry from the re-usable data of an ongoing European project. This use-case is expected to contribute to a better understanding of the CAN physiology and seizure-induced dysfunctions.


Long-term vision of a breakthrough for Open & Re-usable Research Data & software: 
1) Open and re-usable sensitive health data: the policy of open and re-usable research data in the field of health is constrained by the strong ethics and regulatory framework protecting such data and the privacy of European citizens. To accommodate these conflicting aims, ORHIEDS and the Human Intracerebral EEG platform (HIP) have devised a specific strategy, whereby on the one hand, the data providers/controllers can securely transfer, store and curate their data on a health-data certified GDPR-compliant infrastructure (HIP), while on the other hand, any potential end-users can be granted the possibility to analyze these data on this infrastructure, through either a desktop-like experience or automated pipelines to enhance reproducibility, using state-of-the-art tools. This allows an optimal protection of sensitive data and maximal availability to the community at large, and the model could be translated to any other fields of health research, given its generic assets and the open-source nature of all its components

2) Large-scale sharing of rare health data: while data sharing and open data are important for all health domains, it is particularly essential for rare medical conditions where breakthrough progress often requires access to data from many centers and countries. ORHIEDS illustrates this issue by tackling data acquired in less than 2000 patients worldwide every year, with an average of only 10 patients per center. Here, the main challenge is to provide effective incentives to the data providers for them to participate in an international data sharing and open data endeavour. This objective is also at the core of the HIP strategy, as delineated below.

In summary, ORHIEDS aims at showcasing the unique value and capacity of the HIP platform to promote open data and re-usable data in the field of health. Its long term legacy shall be a successful worldwide expansion of iEEG data sharing through the HIP and EBRAINS platforms, leading to many breakthrough advances in the field of neurosciences and mental health, but also a powerful model to follow by other health research fields facing the same challenges.

The ORHIEDS project aims, through the HIP, to initiate the creation of the first European
database that tackles the current limitations of SEEG-based human brain research by
promoting international collaboration and transfer of knowledge in the field.

Specific and measurable objectives include:
1) to collect, curate and analyse full iEEG recordings from 100 patients who underwent epilepsy surgery following SEEG, with the aim to correlate the presence of VHFOs on some channels with the surgical resection and outcome 
2) to collect, curate and analyse cognition-related iEEG recordings obtained during an attention task from 100 patients, to further describe the neural network underlying this brain function and understand how epilepsy can disrupt it
3) to collect, curate and analyse iEEG/EKG/SpO2 recordings obtained in 100 patients, including 20 with concomitant wrist worn recordings of PPG, EDA and 3D-accelerometry, to further map the central autonomic network 
4) to editorialise all collected data into EBRAINS knowledge graph
5) to provide the research community at large access to well harmonised open iEEG data, structured as BIDS datasets, from 100 patients 
6) to onboard half of the ERN EpiCare SEEG centers in the project to participate in iEEG data sharing and HIP usage
7) to integrate new specific workflows in the HIP dedicated to: i) HFOs detection and curation, and ii) power spectral analysis of cognition-triggered iEEG local field potential
By achieving these objectives, ORHIEDS will clearly provide and validate an innovative solution for public and restricted sharing and analysis of iEEG data at scale well beyond the capacities of existing platforms in the field. This shall represent a true breakthrough in the development of iEEG-based research and its impact in the field of neurosciences and mental health. Furthermore, its generic functionalities will offer a novel state-of-the-art concept that can be easily translated to any other medical domains aiming to promote open access to sensitive data.

**Overall project design** 
The overall design of the project consists in running state-of-the-art scientific use-cases upon 
our recently developed open-source platform (HIP), specifically designed to enable and 
promote large scale sharing and public access to sensitive health data, and more specifically 
iEEG data. We believe this approach to be very novel and original.

**Scientific project design**
All three scientific use-cases are thus based on the collection, curation, sharing and analysis of iEEG data, which will be eventually made public (unless forbidden by individual patients). These data will be for the most part retrospective, having been already acquired by the participating centers during clinical routine or research activities. Yet, some data will be collected prospectively during the project.

In our view, the sample size of 100 patients for each of our three scientific use-cases is an appropriate target for this project. Nevertheless, we hope that a larger number can be achieved during the time course of ORHIEDS, and plan to continue to expand these studies after the end of ORHIEDS.

Reproducibility is an important aspect of data analyses, and one of the important aims of open data. In ORHIEDS, we will promote reproducibility of findings by using well defined iEEG data format (BIDS EEG), as well as workflows and pipelines (in particular for the localisation of each recording lead in individual patient’s brain) to harmonize the datasets collected from each center and their analysis. Furthermore, all data processings performed on HIP are recorded, tracked and thus transparent to others who can then reproduce these processings and check the reproducibility of their outputs. Making iEEG data open will further promote this capacity.
