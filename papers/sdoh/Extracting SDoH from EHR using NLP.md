## Intro 
The annual County Health Rankings ([County Health Rankings & Roadmaps](https://www.countyhealthrankings.org/)) gauge the impact of a wide range of health factors by ranking the health outcomes of the over 3000 counties across the United States.

Social, economic, and physical environment factors contribute the most to health outcomes (50%), followed by health behaviors (30%).

Attempts to improve standardization at the national level have been made by the Protocol for Responding to and Assessing Patientsâ€™ Assets, Risks, and Experiences (PRAPARE) (https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2014/ p0501-preventable-deaths.html) and the National Academy of Medicine (https://nam.edu/social-determinants-of-health-101-for-healthcare-five-plus-five/).

The screening resulted in 128 articles from PubMed and Scopus, and 11 articles from ACL Anthology for the full text review.

SDoH categories that were not evaluated in the County Health Rankings (such as race, ethnicity, mental health conditions, or stress) were not included in our study.
