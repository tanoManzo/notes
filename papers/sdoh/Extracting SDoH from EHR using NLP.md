## Intro 
The annual County Health Rankings ([County Health Rankings & Roadmaps](https://www.countyhealthrankings.org/)) gauge the impact of a wide range of health factors by ranking the health outcomes of the over 3000 counties across the United States.

Social, economic, and physical environment factors contribute the most to health outcomes (50%), followed by health behaviors (30%).

Attempts to improve standardization at the national level have been made by the Protocol for Responding to and Assessing Patientsâ€™ Assets, Risks, and Experiences (PRAPARE) (https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2014/ p0501-preventable-deaths.html) and the National Academy of Medicine (https://nam.edu/social-determinants-of-health-101-for-healthcare-five-plus-five/).


A final total of 82 publications were included in this study at the end of the full text review process. We also searched references of all82 articles, and most of these publications overlap with our search results. The included articles were published between 2005 and 2021

SDoH categories that were not evaluated in the County Health Rankings (such as race, ethnicity, mental health conditions, or stress) were not included in our study.

## SDoH Categories

## Supervised methods
Furthermore, we observed 7 studies that investigated deep learning algorithms for SDoH extraction Convolutional neural network (CNN) and feedforward neural network (FNN) performed poorly compared to traditional ML algorithms, such asSVM, random forests, Classification and Regression Tree (CaRT), and AdaBoost due to scarcity of annotated data for identifying SDoH such as alcohol abuse, substance abuse, homelessness, and sexual orientation.33 In more recent work, Lybarger et al42 used Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) for embedding, Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) for trigger and label identification, and Conditional Random Field (CRF) for SDoH span identification.
