Phonetics is a branch of linguistics that deals with the study of the sounds used in speech. It involves the analysis and classification of the physical sounds of human speech, as well as the physiological and acoustic mechanisms underlying the production, transmission, and reception of these sounds. Phonetics is concerned with the study of speech sounds regardless of their role in a particular language or their grammatical function.
