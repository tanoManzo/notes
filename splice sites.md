Splice sites are specific DNA sequences in a gene that mark the boundaries between exons and introns, and they play a crucial role in the process of RNA splicing. RNA splicing is the removal of introns ([[non-coding regions 1]]) and the joining of exons (coding regions) to produce a mature messenger RNA (mRNA) transcript that can be translated into a protein. Splice sites are recognized by the cellular machinery responsible for splicing, including small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs) and other splicing factors.

There are two main types of splice sites:

1. **Donor Splice Site (5' Splice Site):**
   - The donor splice site is located at the 5' end of an intron.
   - It is typically characterized by the consensus sequence GU at the beginning of the intron.
   - The donor splice site is where the spliceosome (the complex of snRNPs and other proteins) recognizes and initiates the splicing process.

2. **Acceptor Splice Site (3' Splice Site):**
   - The acceptor splice site is located at the 3' end of an intron.
   - It is characterized by the consensus sequence AG at the end of the intron.
   - The acceptor splice site is where the spliceosome cleaves the RNA and joins the adjacent exons.

In addition to the core splice sites, there are also additional sequences that influence the efficiency and accuracy of splicing. These include:

- **Branch Point:**
  - A sequence, typically represented by the consensus sequence YNYURAY, serves as a branch point where the intron forms a lariat structure during the splicing process.

- **Polypyrimidine Tract:**
  - A sequence rich in pyrimidines (C and T) located upstream of the AG acceptor site.

- **Splicing Enhancers and Silencers:**
  - Regulatory elements that influence the recognition and efficiency of splice sites.

The process of recognizing and accurately splicing these sites is carried out by the spliceosome, a complex cellular machinery composed of snRNPs and associated proteins. The spliceosome recognizes the consensus sequences at the splice sites and facilitates the precise removal of introns and joining of exons.

Alternative splicing, where different combinations of exons are spliced together, is a mechanism that allows for increased diversity in the proteins generated from a single gene. The proper recognition of splice sites is essential for the accurate and regulated expression of genes.
