CT perf Head & Neck -
1. CT perfusion study indicates a very small acute infarction in
the
territory of the superior division of the right middle cerebral
artery, in the right frontal lobe, with a small ischemic
penumbra which is significantly larger than the area of
infarction.
2. One mm non-occlusive filling defect in the M1 segment of the
right middle cerebral artery. Punctate hyperdensities in the
right frontal sulci in the ischemic territory may represent
additional thrombus in small vessels.
3. No evidence of appreciable atherosclerosis or hemodynamically
significant stenosis in the cervical arteries.
4. Cervical spondylosis.

PCXR - Lungs are clear. Heart size normal. Pleural surfaces
unremarkable. No evidence of pneumonia.

MRI head - There are three foci of acute infarction in the right
cerebral
hemisphere. One is located in the posterior limb of the internal
capsule and in the posterior putamen. The second involves the
anterior limb of internal capsule and the superior aspect of the
head of the right caudate nucleus. The third acute infarction is
linear in configuration, involving subcortical and deep right
frontal white matter. These infarctions demonstrate faint high
signal on T2-weighted images. There is no significant associated
mass effect. There is no evidence of intracranial blood
products. The major arterial flow voids appear unremarkable,
without evidence of definite occlusion.

There are foci of high T2 signal in the subcortical and
periventricular white matter of the cerebral hemispheres, likely
reflecting mild chronic small vessel ischemic disease. The
ventricles and sulci are normal in size and configuration.

There is mild mucosal thickening in the ethmoid sinuses and in
the right
maxillary sinus.

IMPRESSION: Three areas of acute infarction in the right
cerebral hemisphere, as above. No evidence of intracranial blood
products.

TTE - The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure
is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.

No cardiac source of embolus identified (cannot definitively
exclude).

TEE [**2176-12-6**]: The left atrium is normal in size. No spontaneous
echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left
atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right
atrium/right atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect or patent
foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast
with maneuvers. There is symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The left ventricular cavity size and overall left ventricular
systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There are simple
atheroma in the aortic arch and descending thoracic aorta. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is
seen.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was initially admitted to the NICU for close monitoring
after administration of IV TPA. MRI brain showed acute infarct
in the right putamen and posterior limb of the internal capsule,
another infarct in the right caudate and anterior limb of the
internal capsule, and a right subcortical infarct. He may have
had a large artery thrombosis in the right M1 segment which
later embolized. CTA neck showed no significant atherosclerosis.
He was subsequently called out to the neurology floor.  An echo
was obtained which was negative for source of clot.  He
subsequently underwent a transesophageal echo to further
evaluate which was negative for PFO, ASD, thrombus or complex
aortic plaques (prelim read did show simple arch and descending
aorta atheromas).  He was discharged to rehab and plan was to
consider a Holter monitor to further evaluate his transient
atrial tachycardia. No AF was ever noted on tele. He was started
on Aspirin 81mg QD and continued on Atenolol 25mg QD.  His
Atenolol dose may be titrated up gradually for better blood
pressure and heart rate control. His HgbA1c was 5.6 and his
lipid panel showed mildly elveated LDL, so he was started on
Lipitor 20mg QD. His exam on discharge was significant for LUE
weakness in the 2-4/5 range and LLE weakness in the 3-4/5 range.
