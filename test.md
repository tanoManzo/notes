Left Ventricle - Inferolateral Thickness:  0.9 cm  0.6 - 1.1 cm

Left Ventricle - Diastolic Dimension:  3.5 cm  <= 5.6 cm

Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Moderate LA enlargement. No spontaneous echo
contrast or thrombus in the body of the [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] LAA. All four
pulmonary veins identified and enter the left atrium.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Dilated RA. Left-to-right shunt
across the interatrial septum at rest. Large secundum ASD.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Wall thickness and cavity dimensions were
obtained from 2D images. Normal LV wall thickness, cavity size,
and systolic function (LVEF>55%).

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Dilated RV cavity. Borderline normal RV
systolic function.

AORTA: Normal ascending aorta diameter. Focal calcifications in
ascending aorta. Simple atheroma in aortic arch. Normal
descending aorta diameter. Simple atheroma in descending aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS.
No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild MVP.
Mild mitral annular calcification. Eccentric MR jet. Mild to
moderate ([**1-3**]+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Mildly thickened tricuspid valve leaflets. Mild
to moderate [[**1-3**]+] TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Pulmonic valve not well seen.
Physiologic (normal) PR. Dilated branch PA.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. No TEE related complications. The patient appears
to be in sinus rhythm. Results were personally reviewed with the
MD caring for the patient.
Conclusions
PRE CPB The left atrium is moderately dilated. No spontaneous
echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium
or left atrial appendage. The right atrium is dilated. A
left-to-right shunt across the interatrial septum is seen at
rest. A large secundum atrial septal defect is present (2 cm in
length). Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and
systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). The right ventricular
cavity is significantly dilated. Right ventricular systolic
function is borderline normal. There are simple atheroma in the
aortic arch. There are simple atheroma in the descending
thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is mild anterior mitral valve leaflet prolapse.
An eccentric, posteriorly directed jet of at least miild to
moderate ([**1-3**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild to moderate
tricuspid regurgitation. The right main branch pulmonary artery
is significantly dilated.

POST CPB The right ventricle displays mild global hypokinesis.
Left ventricular systolic function is normal. The interatrial
septum is s/p repair with a patch. No discreet jets are seen
crossing the interatrial septum. There are some small pinholes
of left to right flow seen at the edge of the patch which
disappeared after protamine reversal. Initially after separation
from bypass, inferior EKG changes felt to be secondary to right
coronary air embolus were seen. At that time, the mitral
regurgitation was significantly worse than seen during the
pre-CPB period. After resolution of the EKG changes, the mitral
regirgitation was similar as to that seen pre-CPB. The tricuspid
regurgitation is now mild. The thoracic aorta appears intact.


Brief Hospital Course:
She was taken to the operating room on [**2158-11-7**] where she
underwent an ASD clsure via mini-sterntomy after a minimally
invasive approach was aborted secondary to pleural adhesions.
She also sustained an injury to her right common femoral artery
which was repaired. She was transferred to the ICU in critical
but stable condition. SHe was extubated later that same day. She
was ready for transfer to the flor on POD #1, however was
transferred on day 2. She had atrial fibrillation for which her
beta blocker was increased and she was started on amiodarone, pt
converted with amiodarone to NSR. She is on a amiodarone taper.
She will have this followed up by her cardiologist. POD# 2 chest
tubes removed. Reapeat x-ray no sequele. POD # 3 PW removed. PT
consult obtained. Pt clear for home with VNA. Pt in NSR for 48
hrs post conversion.
